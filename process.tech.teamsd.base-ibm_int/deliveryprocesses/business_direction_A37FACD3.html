    A '<i>high-level</i>’ understanding is gained of what the enterprise is and aspires to become, how it intends to
    achieve its goals and make the desired transition and by what means. What is included in the business direction depends
    upon the nature of the engagement.
</p>
<p>
    At a minimum, the company's vision, mission, goals and strategic direction should be understood and documented. It is
    often enough to provide guidance for analysis and alignment of any functional area of a company, including IT, and to
    provide prioritization criteria for initiatives, programs, projects and even modules of a technology package. This is
    because good vision, mission, goal statements and strategic direction usually identify a future view, a description of
    types of offerings and customers, and means to achieve the desired outcome.
</p>
<p>
    In practice, value propositions, required capabilities and key resources to enable a capability, are replacing the use
    of traditional strategic concepts like Critical Success Factors and Distinctive Competencies.

</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    This work product documents the Client's business direction with a focus on information that will have the greatest
    impact on our IT projects.&nbsp; Learning this information from the client should be a discovery process, gaining more
    about the client's business as we work on additional projects.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Solution design should start with Business Direction and flow all the way through the design.&nbsp; That is, Business
    Direction elements like Objectives and Tactics are the justification for Initiatives, Programs and Projects documented
    in Project Definition.&nbsp; Functional and Non-Functional Requirements are then defined for the Project and
    Architectural Decisions are made defining solution design elements (reflected in Architecture Overview, Component
    Model, Operational Model, etc.) and with any risks or issues identified in the Viability Assessment. &nbsp;

    Although different clients define the following terms differently, the Object Management Group, Inc. (OMG: <a href="http://www.omg.org/" target="_blank">www.omg.org</a>) has defined a Business Motivation Model (BMM) that provides
    a schema or structure for developing, communicating, and managing business plans in an organized manner.&nbsp; TeamSD
    follows the guidance of the OMG in defining this subset of terms for our use with clients.&nbsp; Of course, if the
    client has defined terminology, we should use that.&nbsp; Generally, the following information should be available from
    the client:

    <li>
        <div>
            <strong>Mission</strong> statements are the operational, ethical and financial guiding lights of companies (or
            functional areas). They should articulate the company's dreams, behavior and culture and be broad so that they
            cover all Strategies.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            A <strong>Course of Action</strong> defines <strong><em>what</em></strong> has to be done and includes
            Strategies and Tactics.&nbsp; Note: <strong><em>how well</em></strong> it has to be done is defined in
            Objectives as measures of performance (see below).
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            <strong>Strategies</strong> tend to be long term and fairly broad in scope and are implemented by
            <strong>Tactics</strong>, which tend to be shorter term and narrower in scope.&nbsp; Generally, Strategies are
            selected to move the enterprise towards its goals and Tactics to ensure that it meets its Objectives.&nbsp; A
            Tactic may contribute to the implementation of more than one Strategy.&nbsp; Note: a Tactic is also sometimes
            referred to as an Initiative.&nbsp; Relating Tactics (or Initiatives) to our project can be an effective way of
            explaining the business or IT value of our proposal.

            Directives are categorized as <strong>Business Policies</strong> and <strong>Business Rules</strong>. In
            general, Business Policies exist to govern the Strategies and Tactics. Business Policies are the basis for
            Business Rules which are actionable and more formally structured.&nbsp; Business Rules guide Business
            Processes.&nbsp; Directives can place constraints on our decisions and the solution design.

    <li>
        <div>
            A <strong>Vision</strong> is long-term and an overall image of what the company (or a functional area) wants to
            be or become. The Mission makes the Vision operational.

    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Desired Results are <strong>Goals</strong> and Objectives.&nbsp; A Goal tends to be longer term, and defined
            qualitatively rather than quantitatively.&nbsp; Our focus will often be the Goals that relate to our project
            (for example, a specific functional area). A client's Goals may be based on their Client Imperatives which may
            be informed by IBM's Industry Imperatives.&nbsp;See the Client Imperative artifact for further information.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            An <strong>Objective</strong> provides the basis for measuring whether progress is being made towards a Goal.
            An Objective should be measurable, that is, have criteria to determine whether it has been reached or not.
            Objectives support Courses of Action by measuring the results of those actions.&nbsp;For cases where an IBM
            Industry Imperative is the initial basis for an opportunity, the Industry Imperative describes candidate
            Business Outcomes.&nbsp;These Business Outcomes may influence the Client Business Objectives.&nbsp;

    Including a Business Context Diagram in the description of Business Direction may be useful to describe the identity of
    the business area being served in a project.&nbsp; This diagram can show interactions with other businesses or with
    other functional areas within the business.&nbsp; This understanding is key to developing a system that is properly
    situated in the client's business.<br />
    <br />
    In addition, Business Context Diagrams:
</p>
<ul dir="ltr">
    <li>
        <div>
            Provide the source of business events that occur across the business or functional boundary.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Act as a framework for determining the set of business processes to focus on.&nbsp;
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Articulate the scope of the business area being served by the new information system.<br />
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Various Business Context Diagrams can be examined and discussed with the client as a way of clarifying which business
    interactions are in scope, and which are out of scope, of the area of interest.&nbsp; Remember, <strong>for pre-sale
    solution design (Team Solution Design users)</strong>, creating this artifact&nbsp;is more of a "discovery process"
    than a creation process.

    Challenge the management team's statements on measurability and feasibility.
</p>
<p>
    Very often, Business goals, and CSF's are not well defined.&nbsp; If this is the case try to convince the management
    team to work on this as their preparation to the Business Focus Workshop.&nbsp; MetaPlan can really help doing this
    effectively and efficiently.
</p>
<p>
    Find out how a business direction process is used in the organization.&nbsp; Find out what management layers have
    influence on a mission, goals, strategy, CSF’s and key performance indicators (KPI) process. Is it a yearly process or
    dynamic, used or put away in a bottom drawer? How is the terminology used?
</p>
<p>
    Find out if the Management team – especially the members of the HR and marketing organizations – are familiar with
    accessibility standards for their on-line information and services.&nbsp; While your customer may not be under a
    government regulation requiring that it makes its information and services accessible, customers with e-business models
    may recognize substantial brand value from ensuring that their information, services and business processes are
    accessible.
</p>
<p>
    Additionally, where e-Government and e-business are gaining momentum, the accessibility of information and services is
    shifting from solely a regulatory mandate to an explicit element of the organization’s vision and mission.
</p><p/><p>
    <strong><em>Note:</em></strong>&nbsp; With the increasing degrees of uncertainty brought on by e-business,
    practitioners might wish to familiarize themselves with Stephan Haeckel's book Adaptive Enterprise.&nbsp; Traditional
    concepts regarding strategic direction will be profoundly tested and practitioners should be aware of the changes and
    be able to articulate a required strategy in the new information economy brought on by e-business.&nbsp; The following
    are excerpts from the introduction and first chapter of this book.
</p>
<p>
    <em>In the information economy brought on by e-business, traditional content within vision, mission, goals etc. is
    changing rapidly and successful companies are articulating strategic directions from a "sense & respond"
    perspective, rather than a "make and sell" perspective, meaning that strategic directions should be based on a highly
    anticipative modular organization with mechanisms that rapidly identify what a customer believes are of value instead
    of trying to predict what customers want, making it and then pushing it to them.&nbsp; The latter is that structure
    follows strategy rather than strategy as structure.&nbsp;</em>
</p>
<p>
    <em>Over time, companies will create a "context" that unambiguously establishes what the firm does and the constraints
    for how it does it.&nbsp; Leaders will specify how employees interrelate to achieve an organization's purpose.&nbsp;
    The elements of the "context" thus established can be seen as analogous to the traditional concepts of mission, policy
    and organization, but with some important differences.&nbsp; As long as the employees stay within the parameters
    defined by the context, the business empowers them to determine for themselves how best to deliver results for which
    they have been made accountable.&nbsp; The result is that context and coordination replace traditional command and
    control.&nbsp; As individuals in the organization adapt to differing customer requests, always staying within the
    current organizational context, leadership actively seeks out environmental and internal signals that will help it
    improve the organizational context itself.&nbsp; What happens is that the sense and respond alternative implies a
    different way in expressing strategy.&nbsp; Once a company organizes itself to recognize current customer needs and
    responds to them, it no longer operates from a strategic plan.&nbsp; Now the DESIGN of its systematic capability to
    respond to unanticipated customer requests expresses its strategy (strategy as a structure as opposed to traditional
    strategic direction where structure follows strategy a process which now takes too long to effectively respond in the
    information economy of e-business).</em>
</p>
<p>
    Be aware of the language and notation that the client’s organization is using. While this work product uses commonly
    accepted definitions, the terms vision, mission, goals etc. are often used slightly differently.
</p>
<p>
    The company’s culture, structure, maturity or economic positions all define the client’s business direction. The
    strategic direction should ultimately be "grounded": we consider it to be grounded when it is cascaded throughout the
    organization, processes and functions and is proactively managed.

</table>The danger is that the new business will not have the appropriate focus, or not impose the required changes.
Changes might be driven solely by a technology specialist selecting specific technologies or by business engineers changing
processes without a keen understanding of the implications of the technology on the business direction.

        It will have no (or very little) impact on the achievement of the&nbsp;business goals (e.g. when the objective of
        the business solution selection and implementation is to solve an IT issue only).

<p>
    However, even in this case, a clear business direction for the disconnected part of the business is important. It is
    strongly recommended that all engagements and projects should be embedded in the overall business direction. Integral
    management of all parts of the business is essential today.
