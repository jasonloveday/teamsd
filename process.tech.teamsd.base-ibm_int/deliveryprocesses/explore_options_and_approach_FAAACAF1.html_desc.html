    From an outcome perspective, this Activity has the goal of ending with a qualified opportunity where we have identified
    a project which is well aligned with IBM’s ability to deliver and will provide quality value to the client. The
    process, which is collaborative with the client, involves identifying the scope and high-level approach of a candidate
    project based on a clear understanding of a set of requirements derived to satisfy a set of business objectives.
</p>
<p>
    For such a project, IBM and the client should have a clear vision of the solution -- details will be defined in the <a class="elementLink" href="./../../process.tech.teamsd.base-ibm_int/deliveryprocesses/develop_and_agree_to_client_solution_54C3D910.html" guid="_f4FaYekLEd-IPpFA2ds-HA">DEVELOP and Agree to Client Solution</a>&nbsp;activity. Is this project, as defined by
    our knowledge of the requirements and our initial vision of the solution, going to be successful for the client and
    IBM? If our best assessment is "yes", then the opportunity is "qualified" and we proceed with further solution design.
    If not, we need to either work with the client to redefine the requirements and Project Description (scope, timeframe,
    functional and non-functional requirements) or we should decline to participate in the project. It is this honest
    assessment of our capabilities versus the client's expectations that will yield the most successful projects for the
    client and IBM. This is of particular importance if the Solution Design activity is in response to a specific
    solicitation such as a RFP. In other opportunity environments, this activity may be very iterative as the Technical
    Solution Architect works to settle on a project that can be successful for both the client and IBM.
</p>
<p>
    It is during this Activity that most of the requirements are understood and the vision of the solution is formulated.
    The approach taken to define the solution is also decided. Most of the work products created during this Activity will
    be further refined during later Activities. The level of detail needed is just enough to show the client we understand
    their needs. During the next Activity <a class="elementLink" href="./../../practice.tech.presale_sol_design.base-ibm_int/capabilitypatterns/develop_and_agree_to_client_solution_5909977E.html" guid="_lh6Qgb1JEdyrVscmNb_pGw">DEVELOP and Agree to Client Solution</a>), we will show the client we are able to
    address their requirements with the solution we've designed.
</p>
<p>
    At this point in the client buying process, IBM and the client may start with an array of choices and begin to narrow
    them down to the best option. At other times, more preliminary work is needed to explore and establish as set of
    possible options, this is the role of ideation. During Explore consider the impact from the use of optimal IBM
    resources, such as IBM Client Centers, to provide differentiation and additional subject matter industry and technical
    expertise.
</p>
<p>
    Refer to the activity objectives below, but the following are done during this Activity by technical sales.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Assess the opportunity and reconfirm the Buyer Behavior for this Opportunity. Modify our approach to meet each
        individual buyer’s expectations.
    </li>
    <li>
        Identify desired IT capabilities and impact; show how IBM options uniquely meet these needs.
    </li>
    <li>
        Develop benefits and technical components of the business case.
    </li>
    <li>
        Confirm the target solution outcome and approach with the client via some form of playback such as demonstrations.
    </li>
    <li>
        Identify technical resources and investment requirements.
    </li>
    <li>
        Identify risks and potential issues.
    </li>
    <li>
        Qualify our pursuit with IBM and align resources.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    We can verify our value when the client sponsor:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Confirms that we understand their desired business/IT capabilities, impact and benefits.
    </li>
    <li>
        Confirms the IBM preferred approach that meets their desired needs.
    </li>
    <li>
        Acknowledges IBM Unique Value and expertise of the team.

<h3>
    Getting Started
</h3>The table below presents a set of objectives to be completed within this activity. The objectives are supported by
links to specific guidance. Other noteworthy tips and considerations are also presented.<br />
<br />
After the table, there are pointers to more targeted guidance either in the form of solution domain specific whitepapers or
a set of specific recipes. You should review the Objective-based guidance for the overall approach but then investigate the
targeted guidance section before proceeding. If there is an opportunity to engage with the customer in an IBM Design
Thinking workshop to help drive the scope and outcome for an opportunity, then it is valuable to review the <a class="elementLink" href="./../../process.tech.teamsd.base-ibm_int/guidances/guidelines/teamsd_and_design_thinking_B7DA1177.html" guid="_wSS6APriEeSgEdpqkDCQYQ">IBM Design Thinking and Agile with Team Solution Design</a>.<br />

                    the target goal of the solution is made transparent with extensive playbacks with all parties involved.

                    The overall plan for the solution should be stated in a series of <strong>Hills</strong>. These capture
                    a target outcome for a particular Persona with an associate value measure (wow factor). All

                    As the details of the Solution approach are worked out, the discrete functions of the solution should
                    be described and captured. Guidance for this can be found in the task, <a class="elementLink" href="./../../practice.tech.presale_sol_design.base-ibm_int/tasks/identify_outline_rqmts_6AA01255.html" guid="_TIwFoO7SEdyAJNMldIXJlA">Identify and Outline Requirements</a>&nbsp;and typically will start with

                Understanding the solution requirements from the perspective of the critical users and stakeholders is
                crucial. A <strong>Customer Workshop</strong> (see <a class="elementLink" href="./../../practice.tech.presale_sol_design.base-ibm_int/guidances/guidelines/consult_tech_selling_via_discovery_pov_3001E66E.html" guid="_Wqj88Lw9Eea83pW3ykw4Ew">Consultative Technical Selling Via Discovery – PoV – Customer Workshop</a>&nbsp;) can be an effective way to take one or more business scenarios mapped out in a PoV and
                develop an agreed upon set of Hills along with potential user/system interactions via one or more
                prototypes.<br />
                If the customer has settled on a particular [set of] technologies to be delivered, specialized Customer
                Workshops, can be an effective tool to establish concrete business and technology outcome goals
                (potentially within a strategic roadmap) as well as a means to capture detailed functional and
                non-functional requirements.<br />
                Requirements will continue to be elaborated during the Develop activity. The approach should be to
                establish high-level requirements during Explore and then develop requirements specific to the solution
                details as those architecture decisions are made.

                Many solutions will be heavily dependent on internal and/or external data. It is important to understand
                the nature of the data sources (where are they, how can it be accessed, what are its properties, …).
                Guidance supporting this investigation can be found in the task,<a class="elementLink" href="./../../practice.tech.presale_sol_design.base-ibm_int/tasks/identify_high_level_data_sources_62EC7532.html" guid="_9C7KcPaGEdyQkoYzAyZ7Vg">Identify High Level Data Sources</a>.<br />
                For communication, it will be necessary to create one or more sketches of the proposed solution in a format

                    There will be many constraints and potential risks to success that will emerge as you outline a
                    proposed solution design. It is critical that these be documented and be front and center as you
                    proceed. In particular, Risks to project success may lead to identifying alternative approaches to
                    deliver similar capabilities in a way that are better matched to the client and delivery teams’
                    environments and ability. Guidance for how to manage an ongoing assessment of the proposed project can

                Repeatable solutions benefit both the customer and IBM. Such opportunities will have lower risk, faster
                time to delivery and potentially lower costs.<br />
                When you survey candidate assets, you will also be identifying individual or organizational expertise that

                Although called out in the Understand activity, considering a Roadmap strategy may be revisited as a
                Solution starts to unfold. Is there a way to deliver a proposed solution in stages, delivering incremental
                value, with perhaps a more enticing timeline and incremental cost for the customer? This is addressed
                within the discussion of Solution Optimization in the task, <a class="elementLink" href="./../../practice.tech.presale_sol_design.base-ibm_int/tasks/survey_candidate_assets_A8496777.html" guid="_89mTIKc1EdyaUuyek1jM3w">Survey Candidate Assets and Optimize Solution Approach</a>.

        for the current opportunity, the techniques applied will often span both the Understand and Explore activities. A
        critical element is collaborating with the customer to determine the target outcome(s) for the project. Very good
        general guidance on this can be found in the task, <a class="elementLink" href="./../../process.tech.teamsd.base-ibm_int/tasks/ideation_DE7D51B3.html" guid="_TU4RUNxKEeSK_fH7qhcZdQ">Ideation</a>. This is a very good starting point. Many of the techniques describe in
        the Ideation task are further elaborated on in the Solution Design Recipes and guidance paper listed next.

        <strong>Discovery – PoV – Customer Workshop:</strong> This is a collaborative selling approach which covers most of
        the Understand and Explore activities of TeamSD with distinct customer deliverables of a value-focused Point of
        View and a follow-on Custome Workshop with the goal of jointly (IBM and Client) identifying a roadmap. <a class="elementLink" href="./../../practice.tech.presale_sol_design.base-ibm_int/guidances/guidelines/consult_tech_selling_via_discovery_pov_3001E66E.html" guid="_Wqj88Lw9Eea83pW3ykw4Ew">Consultative Technical Selling Via Discovery – PoV – Customer Workshop</a>. The
        Discovery and PoV steps provide directed guidance to capturing an understanding of the customer needs and an
        initial assessment of opportunities for IBM to partner with the client to deliver meaningful business value. This
        Guideline references two detailed whitepapers, one describing the approach to building a PoV and the second one
        providing guidance for planning and executing a Digital Transformation Workshop.

        <strong>Ideation to Hills/Prototype:</strong> This solution design recipe focuses on the techniques and tools to
        help drive a collaborative approach to establishing a target solution vision from an outcome perspective.

    One should be aware of the buyer behavior of the client and consider its impact on the approach and effort taken during
    the explore activity. The client buyer behaviors are:
</p>
<p>
    1.&nbsp;Value for Money: Clients want a specific technology or service from a trusted brand configured and delivered to
    their specifications on time at competitive prices, simply and efficiently.<br />
    2.&nbsp;Trusted Supplier: Clients want innovative, best in class technology and support services, integrated with their
    existing infrastructure, delivered with high-touch project management from one client-focused team from the sale
    through delivery fulfillment.<br />
    3.&nbsp;Innovation Partner: Clients want a customized approach for a complex project with high strategic business
    impact and risk from business-oriented thought leaders and industry experts with a deep relationship-based
    understanding of the client.

    The following diagram helps show the relationship between Team Solution Design work products and the Team Solution
    Design Activity they are first created in. The diagram has been simplified to show only primary flows and to "fit" the

    The following chart shows the overall Quality Practices process and governance with the timing of various reviews and
    delivery involvement. Specifically, in Team Solution Design, the Pre-Bid Consulting and the Risk Manager, if assigned,
    become involved at <strong>Task: Conduct Viability Assessment</strong>, if not sooner in <strong>Activity: EXPLORE
    Options and Approach</strong>. TDA/SAR and ITR occur at <strong>Task: Evaluate Integrated Solution</strong> in
    <strong>Activity: DEVELOP and Agree to Client Solution</strong> before the solution is proposed to the client.
