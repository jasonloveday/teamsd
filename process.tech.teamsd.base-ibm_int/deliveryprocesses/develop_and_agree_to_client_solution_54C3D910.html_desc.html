    The purpose of this pre-sale solution design step (step 3 of CVM) is to jointly develop and propose a solution that
    provides value to both the client and IBM.&nbsp; Both the client and IBM reach final agreement on how the solution will
    be implemented.&nbsp; Starting with the client's value drivers and expectations for the opportunity, the team agrees to
    provide the promised value in the solution we propose, including implementation, and in the manner in which we engage
    with the client.&nbsp; The outcome of this activity includes:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Client agreed-to proposal
    </li>
    <li>
        Selected solution
    </li>
    <li>
        Value justification (including cost/benefit analysis, image, etc.)
    </li>
    <li>
        Proof of capability (test evaluation, proof of concept)
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The progress indicator for this activity is a final proposal and a signed agreement.&nbsp; That is, the opportunity is
    won (or lost).

    During this Activity, we will design the solution that will address the requirements identified in the "EXPLORE Options
    and Approach" Activity. During the process, we will continue to refine our understanding of the requirements and the
    role played by members of the client team (see Project Description work product).&nbsp; Occasionally, we will even
    learn that a fundamental "fact" that we learned during the Explore Activity is so significant that we need to
    re-evaluate if this opportunity is Qualified.&nbsp; That is, we may decide that our capabilities can not address their
    requirements to the level of their expectations.&nbsp; When this is the case, we must either redefine the project so
    that the client and IBM can be successful or let the client know that we will not be proposing a solution.
</p>
<p>
    At this point in the client buying process, the buyer may use an evaluation procedure to determine the best option
    (e.g., RFP, business case, customized demo, proof-of-concept, test evaluation, test for indicators of performance, or
    other "proof").&nbsp; An evaluation plan is implemented to select the solution alternative, including the best
    products. The solution is reviewed to determine what validation is required to ensure success.&nbsp; Any concerns
    associated with the decision of a specific option are overcome.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    The following are done during this Activity by technical sales:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Design/develop solution, specify components – include IBM or client Delivery Owner.
    </li>
    <li>
        Determine solution performance and impact.
    </li>
    <li>
        Provide input for refined benefits and business case – Value Proposition.
    </li>
    <li>
        Support QA and engage Risk Manager, if appropriate.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        Define project tasks, responsibilities, timeline in a high level Project Plan.
    </li>
    <li>
        Define delivery requirements.&nbsp; Ensure IBM and client delivery resources are assigned and the delivery leaders
        are in place.
    </li>
    <li>
        Present our proposal, negotiate a contract.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    During this Activity, we will take at least two opportunities to involve our peers, that are not directly involved in
    the project, to take an objective, outside view of our work.&nbsp; In the first (Task: <a class="elementLink" href="./../../practice.tech.presale_sol_design.base-ibm_int/tasks/survey_candidate_assets_A8496777.html" guid="_89mTIKc1EdyaUuyek1jM3w">Survey Candidate Assets and Optimize Solution Approach</a>), we'll assess our initial
    view of the solution to ensure that we have not repeated a pattern which has caused unsuccessful projects in the
    past.&nbsp; One of those common mistakes is to not exploit applicable assets.&nbsp; Whether we use a formal approach
    like a Solution Optimization Workshop, or ask the opinion of someone we respect, an outside view can helps us make sure
    that we are on the right path.&nbsp; (See Task: <a class="elementLink" href="./../../practice.tech.presale_sol_design.base-ibm_int/tasks/survey_candidate_assets_A8496777.html" guid="_89mTIKc1EdyaUuyek1jM3w">Survey Candidate Assets and Optimize Solution Approach</a>.)
</p>
<p>
    The second time (Task: <a class="elementLink" href="./../../practice.tech.presale_sol_design.base-ibm_int/tasks/evaluate_integrated_solution_F80EE0CC.html" guid="_nmJ_AKc2EdyaUuyek1jM3w">Evaluate Integrated Solution</a>) we take an objective view of the project with the help
    of our peers will be when we do a formal assessment of the solution we will be proposing.&nbsp; Strong linkage to the
    IBM Business Unit quality practices must occur to gain necessary approvals and guidance that the solution is accurate
    and the risk is acceptable. The Business Unit quality practices will prescribe the type of activities and reviews that
    must be performed during this Team Solution Design&nbsp;Activity.&nbsp; For example, we will be using a Solution
    Assurance Review or Technical Delivery Assessment and Integrated Technical Review when the size, complexity and risk
    warrant it.&nbsp; Depending on our relationship with the client, this will often involve a review of critical parts of
    our solution with key influencers and decision makers (that is, those responsible or accountable).&nbsp; It's rarely a
    good idea to have the client "surprised" by our solution.
</p>
<p>
    We can verify our value when the client decision leader / team confirms and agrees to:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Expected solution performance, impact and benefit.
    </li>
    <li>
        Project Plan, schedule,&nbsp; success criteria and resources - who does what.
    </li>
    <li>
        Price and terms.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    At the end of this Activity, the opportunity is Won and the transition to implementation can begin.<br />
