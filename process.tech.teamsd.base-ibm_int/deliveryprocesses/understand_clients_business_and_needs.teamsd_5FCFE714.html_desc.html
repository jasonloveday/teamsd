<td class="sectionTableSingleCell">The purpose of the CVM Plan phase is to evaluate the client's business environment and the client/IBM relationship.
Building on the client relationship and understanding of the client's issues, the IBM team, including the Technical
Solution Architect, explores a specific issue and UNDERSTANDS the client's desired approach to solve it. The team confirms
WHAT value the client wants (value drivers) and HOW they want it (client expectations) for this opportunity. The Technical
Solution Architect provides technical insight and produces the Technical Account Plan and contributes to the identification
of a validated Opportunity.</td>

    At this point in the buying process, the client evaluates the business environment, that is, evaluates the environment
    and factors affecting competitive position. The Technical Solution Architect provides technical leadership to evaluate
    and analyze the client/IBM relationship, the client's competitors, business capabilities and industry trends from a
    technical point of view. This will require us to apply the in depth knowledge of the client's environment, political
    structure, and future needs which we gained from prior project experience and our close working relationship with key
    technical executives.
</p>
<p>
    Our approach in this Understand the Client Activity is "outside in". That is, we start by understanding the business
    climate, the industry trends, the key issues and competitors. Then, we understand the client, their business,
    capabilities and organization. Next, we focus on their IT environment, capabilities, skills and needs. Most of this
    understanding will come from our ongoing involvement with the client and will only be updated during this Team Solution
    Design Activity.
</p>
<p>
    Using knowledge of the customer's strategic direction and current business and technical needs, the focus then turns to
    how IBM could deliver significant client value. This insight should be long-term and focused on establishing or
    managing the relationship between IBM and the client. The scope might be 3-5 years, such as represented by a Strategic
    Roadmap or 1-3 years as reflected in the Technical Account Plan. Finally, we identify an opportunity. This might be
    simple -- we are responding to a client request or there is a single, obvious business or IT problem to focus on. At
    other times it may focus on a broad initiative derived from the technical account plan with details expected to be
    refined during the <a class="elementLink" href="./../../process.tech.teamsd.base-ibm_int/deliveryprocesses/explore_options_and_approach_FAAACAF1.html" guid="_e9hPkekLEd-IPpFA2ds-HA">EXPLORE Options and Approach</a>&nbsp;activity.
</p>
<p>
    This work in the UNDERSTAND activity includes the following:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Identify client business and IT issues, priorities and preferences.
    </li>
    <li>
        Identify needs - desired business capabilities and impact. Confirm the client's value drivers and expectations.
    </li>
    <li>
        Build relationships and respond to issues.
    </li>
    <li>
        Identify the buying behavior for the opportunity.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    We can verify our value when the client:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Validates our understanding of their business issues and priorities and compelling reason to act.
    </li>
    <li>
        Shares their business and/or IT strategy with us.
    </li>
    <li>
        Participates in Team IBM Account Planning.
    </li>
    <li>
        Affirms the value of the IBM team.
    </li>
    <li>
        The client decision leader / team is engaged.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    At this point, we consider the opportunity Validated.

    Getting Started
</h3>
<p class="ui-content" data-role="collapsible">
    The table below presents a set of objectives to be completed within this activity. The objectives are supported by
    links to specific guidance. Other noteworthy tips and considerations are also presented. In this activity you should
    always complete the Discovery objective. You will also complete the “Tactical Assessment” or the “Strategic Assessment”
    objective depending on the nature of the client engagement.<br />
    <br />
    After the table, there are pointers to more targeted guidance either in the form of solution domain specific
    whitepapers or a set of specific recipes. You should review the Objective-based guidance for the overall approach but
    then investigate the targeted guidance section before proceeding. If there is an opportunity to engage with the
    customer in an IBM Design Thinking workshop to help in the identification of opportunities, then it is valuable to
    review the <a class="elementLink" href="./../../process.tech.teamsd.base-ibm_int/guidances/guidelines/teamsd_and_design_thinking_B7DA1177.html" guid="_wSS6APriEeSgEdpqkDCQYQ">IBM Design Thinking and Agile with Team Solution Design</a>.

    There are a set of <strong><font color="blue">Engagement Specific Guidance</font></strong> whitepapers maintained
    outside of the method within a <a href="http://ibm.biz/SupplGuidelines" target="_blank">method guidance Wiki</a>. Here
    you will find guidance from guidance papers such as TeamSD Cloud Guidance that provide targeted guidance when designing
    a Cloud-focused solution.

<div class="ui-content" data-role="collapsible">
    <br />
    In addition, there are a range of techniques and recipes, most of which span both the Understand and Explore
    activities.

    <strong>Discovery – POV – Client Workshop:</strong> This is a collaborative selling approach which covers most of the
    Understand and Explore activities of TeamSD with distinct customer deliverables of a value-focused Point of View and a
    follow-on Client Workshop with the goal of jointly (IBM and Client) identifying a roadmap. <a class="elementLink" href="./../../practice.tech.presale_sol_design.base-ibm_int/guidances/guidelines/consult_tech_selling_via_discovery_pov_3001E66E.html" guid="_Wqj88Lw9Eea83pW3ykw4Ew">Consultative Technical Selling Via Discovery – PoV – Customer Workshop</a>. The
    Discovery and PoV steps provide directed guidance to capturing an understanding of the customer needs and an initial
    assessment of opportunities for IBM to partner with the client to deliver meaningful business value. This Guideline
    references two detailed whitepapers, one describing the approach to building a PoV and the second one providing
    guidance for planning and executing a Digital Transformation Workshop.<br />
    <br />
    <strong>From Idea Generation to IBM Design Thinking [recipe]:</strong> This Solution Design recipe has as an outcome
    the execution of an IBM Design Thinking Workshop with the customer to develop a sponsored project along with an initial
    prototype to support opportunity pursuits . (See <a class="elementLink" href="./../../practice.tech.presale_sol_design.base-ibm_int/guidances/guidelines/guidance_recipes_B95AA550.html" guid="_NJ8WwLxHEea83pW3ykw4Ew">Solution Design Recipes</a>). The guidance provided by this recipe is mostly focused on
    the Ideation activities (also aligned with the Digital Transformation Workshop in the previous approach), but there is
    extensive supporting Understand activity elements that are essential to the success of this recipe and are called out
    in both the approach and assumptions.<br />
    <br />
    <strong>Observations:</strong><br />
    Both of the above practices collaboratively engage with the client to identify high-valued opportunities. The goal of
    these is a qualified opportunity and there is little formal focus on the intermediary milestone of identifying a
    validated opportunity. The result are iterative approaches that span the Understand and Explore activities, with
    Ideation and formal Requirements gathering being an integral part of identifying an opportunity.

    If you are a Technical Solution Architect that is not dedicated to working with the client, you can accelerate this
    Activity by consulting with the IBM Client team. In this case ensure that you debrief with the technical sales leader
    on the IBM client team and consult the Technical Account Plan.

    The following diagram helps show the relationship between Team Solution Design work products and the Team Solution
    Design Activity they are first created in. The diagram has been simplified to show only primary flows and to "fit" the
    chart. See the Activity Work Breakdown Structures or individual tasks for more detail. Note that there are several work
    products to aid in understanding the client context and potential opportunities.
