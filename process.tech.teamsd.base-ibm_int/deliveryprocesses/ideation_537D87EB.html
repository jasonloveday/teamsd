    For a growing class of systems - Systems of Engagement - our clients are looking for a more collaborative and agile
    approach from IBM to understand and even jointly discover how technology can enable a compelling initiative for their
    business.&nbsp; For business clients in particular, an approach that is based solely on traditional IT artifacts may
    not connect readily with the vocabulary and context for the given business domain.
</p>
<p>
    In this task we choose to highlight the use of the IBM Design Thinking technique. You may choose to select another
    approach for Ideation based on your client’s culture or the specific domain of interest. You should particularly
    consider these leading capabilities, described in more detail in the Alternatives section below: – either can also be
    combined with the use of IBM Design Thinking:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Innovation Thinking approaches are very valuable, with workshops tailored to different client scenarios, and can
        now be combined with IBM Design Thinking
    </li>
    <li>
        Client Centers are a valuable resource with industry and technical expertise to help you advance the proposed value
        for your client.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The IBM Design Thinking approach is a major initiative in IBM for Product Management that injects a focus on the Design
    of Software Products and Offerings. Elements of IBM Design Thinking are also relevant to Services teams with expertise
    in User Experience design.
</p>
<p>
    In this task, the objective is to explore with the client Ideas for how a business solution, leveraging information
    technology, can meet their objectives for a specific initiative. The recommended approach to Ideation is to apply a
    subset of IBM Design Thinking during the technical sales process. There is particular value to our business clients in
    this approach as it focuses more on the business outcomes and customer experience they want to achieve with their
    offerings to the market. IBM Design Thinking documentation (primer and fuller guide) is available <a href="./../../process.tech.teamsd.base-ibm_int/guidances/supportingmaterials/references_ibm_design_and_gbs_agile_F928C745.html" guid="__9qbIPrsEeSgEdpqkDCQYQ">here</a>.

<p>
    <img alt="IBM Design Thinking summary view" src="./../../process.tech.teamsd.base-ibm_int/tasks/./resources/dt_approach_ideation.png" width="500" height="333" />
</p>
<p>
    IBM Design Thinking has three core practices - <strong>Hills, Sponsor Users</strong> and <strong>Playback</strong>. You
    may want to leverage Playback in an initial delivery engagement. From a technical sales perspective, during Ideation,
    your focus should be on Hills and Sponsor Users. For a broader view of the use of Design Thinking in Technical Sales
    consult the guidance paper referenced in this task.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Hills</strong> focus your project on big problems and outcomes for users, not just a list of feature
        requests
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Sponsor Users</strong> help you design experiences for real target users, rather than imagined needs
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    IBM Design Thinking would typically take several workshops to Understand and Explore a solution with a client. For the
    purpose of this task, we assume that the client has agreed to a 4 hour workshop during the presales discussions. Each
    situation will vary, but general guidance suggests that more investment in exploring a solution design with a client
    would require deeper specialist skills in user experience design and an initial contract.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    This Ideation task begins with a client discussion where you offer the option of a Design Thinking workshop to your
    Client. This may require an introduction to the IBM Design Thinking approach and its successes to date with IBM
    products. Once they have agreed, then you can work with them to plan and perform the workshop and communicate the
    results.

    business and go-to-market aspects of the solution.

    Set the duration and the expectation for the results from the workshop. Draft a version of the Hills for the initiative

    <strong>IBM Client Centers</strong>
</p>
<p>
    To advance an opportunity and demonstrate IBM industry, research and/or technology differentiation, consider using an
    IBM Client Center. There are two styles of Client Center – those with an industry solution focus and others where a
    client can see more of the art of the possible from IBM Research.
</p>
<p>
    The <a href="http://ibm.biz/gisc2015" target="_blank">Global Industry Solution Centers</a> provide a custom briefing
    location where you can plan a Client briefing to showcase industry solutions and plan creative engagements to advance a
    client's initiative, e.g exploring via a Proof of Concept.

    been developed and used with clients.<br />
    The workshop types are designed based on client scenarios. Consult this information and select the workshop that best
    meets the needs and style that will be effective with your client.

<p>
    You may use an Innovation Workshop in this task to Ideate on an overall innovation theme and identify a set of tangible
    prioritised ideas and actions to take forward, including the solution design for the prioritized initiatives.

    You will see other types of workshop also listed. These provide the ability to have a range of approaches which can be
