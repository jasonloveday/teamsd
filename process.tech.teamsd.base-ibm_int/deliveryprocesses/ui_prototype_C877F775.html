    Prototypes are used for many purposes:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Designing the user interface: A user interface is impossible to get right the first time. User interface design
        involves iteration. Prototypes give designers a way to explore designs and test them iteratively with users.
    </li>
    <li>
        Clarifying user requirements: Users will give more concrete specifications of what they want the system to do and
        what they don’t want it to do if they are presented with a prototype rather than with analysis diagrams.
    </li>
    <li>
        Clarifying technical requirements and feasibility: Analysis of user interface designs in the context of the
        architecture in which they will be implemented typically reveals numerous technical and accessibility requirements
        and issues.
    </li>
    <li>
        Getting buy-in to the project from the project sponsor: Project sponsors tend to be unimpressed by large quantities
        of analysis documents and diagrams. On the other hand, showing sponsors prototypes early in the development effort
        can improve the designers’ credibility and convey much more information about the system.
    </li>
    <li>
        Getting buy-in from the end users: In general, when users feel they have been involved in the design of a product,
        they are more likely to view it positively.
    </li>
    <li>
        Providing an exit criterion for the design phase.
    </li>
    <li>
        Verifying the user model, use cases, and scenarios.
    </li>
    <li>
        Training users in using the system even before it is released: Normally, user training is deployed at the end of a
        project, after the system has been delivered. The succession of User Interface Prototypes allows some training to
        be carried out much earlier.

    A User Interface Prototype work product is built early in the development cycle with the express purpose of being
    changed and improved as part of the iterative design approach.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    Prototypes can be rendered in a range of fidelities, (e.g., low fidelity (lo-fi) and high fidelity (hi-fi)). They do
    not necessarily need to be working software.
</p>
<p>
    A user interface prototype can be classified along the following dimensions:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Horizontal versus vertical: Horizontal prototypes represent a broad but superficial sampling of the system’s
        function. Vertical prototypes represent a narrow but in-depth range of the system’s function.
    </li>
    <li>
        Evolutionary versus throwaway: Evolutionary prototypes are evaluation vehicles that incorporate evaluation results
        as adjustments and refinements to the prototype. In this fashion, the prototype may eventually evolve, or part of
        it may be incorporated into the production system. Throwaway prototypes are used to test a design concept with no
        intention of reusing the prototype.

    One of the difficulties in the development of User Interface Prototypes is knowing when to stop iterating. The
    following should provide some useful tips for creating prototypes:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Set deadlines at which point the increments of the prototypes will be tested.
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Test each prototype with at least six users; if there is more than one user then plan to test with three to
            four users per segment.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Use scenario-based testing. Use the scenarios from the draft-level use cases as a starting point during lo-fi
            prototyping. Use full description use cases as you move into hi-fi prototyping. The full description use case
            models will provide critical information on data elements, which will affect the eventual detailed layout and
            flows of the views.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            To adequately test the user interface, the prototype must adhere to the underlying information model targeted
            to the specific types of users.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Iterate until all usability problems are resolved.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Consider engaging with an accessibility expert in the development and/or description of the features. Resources
            with accessibility skills will be better able to explain the accessibility considerations when the prototype
            software doesn’t handle accessibility requirements.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Be diligent in specifying details of the user interface in both the prototype and the accompanying text
            specification. Otherwise, developers may design <i>ad hoc</i>, and <i>ad hoc</i> design is rarely successful.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Limit the scope of the prototype to user interface issues and concerns. Do not overload the prototype with
            other issues like performance, persistence, business requirements, or distribution.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Depending on the circumstances and the customer, sometimes it is advisable to develop the User Interface
            Prototypes using different hardware from that used for the final application. This prevents the customer and
            users from seeing great looking user interfaces, consequently assuming that development is nearly complete and
            demanding the system to be delivered immediately.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Lo-fi prototypes have the advantages of being easy and inexpensive to create and discard, thus allowing the
            early exploration and testing of design alternatives with continuous user involvement. They are limited in that
            they do not depict fully certain aspects of the system or application such as visual treatment, response time,
            and interaction “feel.” However, there are several compelling reasons to use lo-fi rather than hi-fi
            prototyping during the high-level design. Users tend to give more honest feedback to designs that do not look
            “finished;” alternatively, they often hold back when reacting to designs that look finished. There is usually
            reduced emotional investment on the part of the creator of the lo-fi prototype, as it is much quicker and
            easier to change or discard a paper-and-pencil rendering than a coded solution. Finally, changes can be made
            “on the fly” to enhance a design based on user feedback.
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Any given design is not to be “frozen” until adequate prototyping is performed.&nbsp; The following is a typical list
    of problems that can be uncovered during the investigation of a prototype:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <div>
            Poor window navigation: Task performance may be made difficult by the nature of the navigation among windows.
            Often the usability of the interface can be significantly improved by tuning the flow of control through the
            windows and the allocation of functions between windows to a particular scenario.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Terminology and labeling: User interaction with prototypes often exposes problems in terminology. For example,
            some users may misinterpret a label because they use the same term to mean something different.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Window layout: Users often respond to a prototype by pointing out ways in which the layout of the controls or
            fields in a window could be more meaningful or more convenient to use.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Menu and tool bar organization. User interaction with prototypes can help assure that the most important and
            frequently used functions are those most accessible through menus, toolbars and other controls.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Setting defaults: It is often possible to save substantial user effort by careful selection of defaults.
            Prototyping offers the user the opportunity to validate default settings and to suggest additional defaults.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Controls usage: User interaction with prototypes often exposes problems in the selection of controls and
            widgets. For example, users may have difficulty in the use of a catalog or notebook, prompting the selection
            from a list box, or in the use of a catalog or notebook, prompting selection of a more meaningful or applicable
            control.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Accessibility: Considerations for how accessibility issues will be addressed for disabled users (eg.low vision,
            blindness, hearing impaired, mobility issues) and interface designs to assistive technology
            (See&nbsp;References).
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;The User Interface Prototype&nbsp;should have the following characteristics:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        It should enable user interaction and useful feedback
    </li>
    <li>
        It should be detailed and complete enough to support some kind of evaluation.&nbsp; Examination of notes taken
        during lo-fi testing sessions and data gathered, such as task completion times, errors, and subjective data during
        prototype evaluation sessions, can indicate whether the prototype was adequate for the intended purpose.
    </li>
    <li>
        It should be based on available data
    </li>

<th class="sectionTableHeading" scope="row">Impact of not having</th><td class="sectionTableCell"><p>
    Not using prototypes makes it impossible to test and refine designs while it is still early enough to change them. Late
    testing to fix such problems is not an adequate substitute; once a design is “frozen,” changes grow increasingly costly
    and, as a consequence, are notoriously difficult to introduce.
</p>
<p>
    Without prototypes, it is difficult for code developers to understand the requirements for the look and feel of a user
    interface, sometimes resulting in contract cost overruns and, often, dissatisfied users. Functional requirements may be
    overlooked, because a written specification of the user interface may not be specific enough or provide as much
    illuminating detail as does a hi-fi prototype. Also:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Functional testers may not have a clear understanding of how the user interface will operate, thus resulting in the
        development of inaccurate test cases.
    </li>
    <li>
        The quality of user assistance may suffer, because a written user interface specification may not be complete
        enough to provide clear direction for a user assistance specialist.

        Project sponsors may not feel comfortable that the project is progressing in a satisfactory fashion.

    The User Interface Prototype is a fundamental building block for user interface design, especially for systems with a
    graphical user interface. On most projects, some form of User Interface Prototype should be built.
</p>
<p>
    If a project is small-scale enough to move directly to actual program code from lo-fi prototypes, it may not be
    necessary to build a hi-fi prototype. However, the argument can be made that the code itself serves the purpose of a
    hi-fi prototype if it is developed early enough to be tested and iteratively refined adequately prior to
