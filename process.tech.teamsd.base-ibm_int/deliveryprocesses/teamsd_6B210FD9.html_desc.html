    The Integration and Value Team project identified five key focus areas that drive the opportunity to create Client
    Value and long-term profitable growth:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Serve <strong><u>distinct types of buying behaviors</u></strong> in our clients, and vary our approach to do this
        profitably.
    </li>
    <li>
        Recognize that selling only creates possibilities, <strong><u>delivering a positive total client experience creates
        value</u></strong>.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong><u>Enhance skills and capabilities</u></strong> to serve the client’s agenda with content.
    </li>
    <li>
        Create Client Value through <strong><u>principles driven leadership and empowered and capable
        employees</u></strong>.
    </li>
    <li>
        Implement a <strong><u>market facing model</u></strong> that places the client’s agenda before our own.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    This Client Value Initiative provided the key drivers for a unified approach to solution design.&nbsp; The key findings
    from the baseline study carried out in Client Value Initiative were:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Disparate processes by brand (account planning, Solution Design, delivery, client sat, IBM planning/measures)
        impeding ‘one face’ to the client.
    </li>
    <li>
        Existing client-facing processes were designed for HW and SW; services processes added later without integration.
    </li>
    <li>
        Processes were designed to handle single brand transactions; multi-brand not handled as well.
    </li>
    <li>
        Client value was not the focus of nor designed into processes which were often optimized for internal needs.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    These factors necessitated adoption of a single pre-sale solution design method for by all brands and service
    organizations which will be defined in the Unified Method Framework.&nbsp; Team Solution Design is that solution design
    method.

    Team Solution Design was designed based on the following principles:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Support SSM/CVM in a coordinated way.
    </li>
    <li>
        Translate selling method activities to counterpart pre-sale technical activities.
    </li>
    <li>
        Keep Team Solution Design as a thin layer that "wraps" and reuses existing methods and assets.&nbsp; Take an
        inclusive approach.
    </li>
    <li>
        Focus on GS Method (now UMF) as primary underlying method.
    </li>
    <li>
        Conform to ADS (Application Description Standard) where relevant.
    </li>
    <li>
        Provide guidance for using appropriate aspects of multiple methods and assets.
    </li>
    <li>
        Provide pre-sale guidance to IT Architects, Specialists and Consultants for activities unique to the pre-sale
        technical role.
    </li>
    <li>
        Support collaboration with others involved in pre-sales and hand-off to delivery ITAs.
    </li>
    <li>
        Provide a sense of community and a forum to share experiences.
    </li>
    <li>
        Update and evolve Team Solution Design based on real pre-sale solution design experiences.
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    The philosophy of Team Solution Design solution design:&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Pre-integrated, flexible method:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Pre-defined process, activities, tasks and work products.&nbsp; No Method Adoption Workshop required.
    </li>
    <li>
        Work products are comprehensive enough to capture input when you get it -- you rarely control timing.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        Provides in-line guidance including use of additional work products and examples of asset reuse.
    </li>
    <li>
        Flexible enough to adapt to reassessment of Buying Behavior or size and complexity (BTT).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        Adds value/framework for vastly different scenarios like partial or brief activities (or part of the solution for
        specialists).
    </li>
    <li>
        Even when a method is not really needed, provides common vocabulary, approach to capturing notes, architectural way
        of thinking.<br />
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>Outside-In technique:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Outside-in approach is used, first with planning and then solution design.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        Natural flow from System Context and Use Cases to Architecture Overview, Component and Operational Models.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        Encourages the reuse of assets, from course-grained to detailed, business to IT, requirements to solution.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>Iterative approach:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Team Solution Design activities drive design process, not tasks or work products.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        Iterative approach with suggested iteration points.
    </li>
    <li>
        Tasks are done as client situation allows, often in parallel.
    </li>
    <li>
        Effective iteration through specific guidance on traceability of each decision back to requirements.
    </li>
    <li>
        Iterative approach allows work products to evolve from general to more specific.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>Varied level of elaboration:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Each work product goes through multiple elaborations -- by you or others before and after the solution is "sold".
    </li>
    <li>
        Earlier versions of work products are useful in their own right. For example:<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First use cases can be used to drive custom demo.<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Services View of Architecture Overview Diagram used to confirm key functions
        needed.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        Includes multiple views (Architecture Overview Diagram), or for a specific audience (Component Model).&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        Allow for the “uneven” level of elaboration likely in pre-sale. What you need to know varies for different parts of
        the solution.
    </li>
    <li>
        Focuses on the level of design needed to ensure the solution will work, even if we are responsible for only a part.
    </li>
    <li>
        Provides just enough detail to assure the client that requirements are understood and solution will address
        them.&nbsp;<br />

<div style="MARGIN-LEFT: 2em">
    <ul>
        <li>
            Aligned with <strong><u>Client Value Method</u></strong> (CVM replaced SSM). This resulted in the renaming and
            re-factoring of phases, activities and some tasks.
        </li>
        <li>
            Provided guidance for solutions emanating from any of the three <strong>Buying Behaviors for the

        </li>
        <li>

        <li>
            Defined Team Solution Design&nbsp;in <strong>UMF</strong>.&nbsp; Work products were re-factored to exploit
            existing UMF content.
        </li>
        <li>
            Added guidance on bringing in delivery and risk management early in solution design and staying involved after
            the contract is signed.&nbsp;
        </li>
        <li>
            Provided alignment with <strong>Quality Practices</strong>.&nbsp; TeamSD work products feed consistent Quality

        </li>
        <li>
            Increased emphasis on <strong>Plan Phase work products</strong>: base of knowledge making opportunity
