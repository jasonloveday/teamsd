<p>
    The purpose of this document is to provide prescriptive guidance on when and how to employ various parts of IBM Design
    Thinking and TeamSD as part of pre-sale solution design. Much more specific guidance can be identified when the
    characteristics of the opportunity and the buying behavior of the client are considered. There are challenges when
    sticking with a single approach as to which techniques and which artifacts need to be produced. This is potentially
    more complex when blending IBM Design Thinking and TeamSD. Part of the guidance is to help to streamline consideration
    and management of the potential set of artifacts to be generated during pre-sale solution design. For additional
    guidance details, also consult the <a href="http://ibm.biz/IDTandTeamSD-WP" target="_blank">supporting whitepaper</a>
    where more details on relationships between the approaches, techniques, and artifacts associated with IBM Design
    Thinking, TeamSD and Agile are discussed.2-Speed IT and its impact on Solution Architecture.
</p>
<p>
    Our customers are dealing with the notion of multi-speed IT where two different parts of systems development and
    operations move at different speed with different characteristics and different operational needs (and outcomes). At
    one end of the spectrum we have agile mode, frequently associated with Systems of Engagement (SoE), that are
    characterized by rapid development, highly innovative, need to fail fast, need to have short/fast ROI and involving
    agile services and infrastructure. The other end of the spectrum we have the traditional mode, representing the Systems
    of Record (SoR), that are characterized by their stability, dominated by Service Level Agreements (SLAs) and mission
    critical NFRs.<br />

<p>
    As part of understanding client needs, it is critical to understand client buyer and organizational expectations and
    which characteristics will drive the development and delivery approach.
</p>
<p>
    With traditional development, we typically have the Big-Up-Front-Design (BUPD*) approach where an architecture is fully
    defined before any development of the solution begins. On the other extreme, with agile development, we have the
    Emergent Design* approach of evolving the design as the system is incrementally built and deployed. However, we know
    that some planning is needed, especially for complex architectural projects, to produce a robust system that addresses
    performance and usability while minimizing redundancy. This leads us to an Intentional Architecture* approach that
    addresses how we support and scale agile teams with a common approach and guidance while enabling us to respond
    efficiently to ever-changing business needs. Hence, we need an Agile Architecture approach that balances emergent
    design and intentional architecture to be able to support current user requirements while evolving the system to
    address future needs through an Architecture Runway* which provides the technical foundation for future development.
</p>
<p>
    (*: from <a href="http://www.scaledagileframework.com/" target="_blank">Scaled Architecture Framework</a>)
</p>
<p>
    Given the characteristics of IBM Design Thinking and the TeamSD, one might be inclined to conclude that IBM Design
    Thinking is more suited for agile projects while TeamSD is more for traditional SoR projects. However, as described in
    the next section, they are complementary and both are needed regardless of the types of systems we are building or the
    modes we are executing in. Remember that TeamSD is an architectural method that is agnostic of development approach.
</p>
<h3>
    IBM Design Thinking and TeamSD as complementary tools
</h3>
<p>
    Both IBM Design Thinking and TeamSD have significant value to the Technical Solution Architect and are complementary to
    each other. The drive toward high impact, user-centric outcomes, the hallmark of IBM Design Thinking, enhances our
    ability to deliver significant client value. The techniques embodied within IBM Design Thinking should always be
    recommended to support the Understand and Explore activities of TeamSD. One such integration of IBM Design Thinking
    techniques into TeamSD is highlighted within the <a class="elementLink" href="./../../../practice.tech.presale_sol_design.base-ibm_int/guidances/guidelines/consult_tech_selling_via_discovery_pov_3001E66E.html" guid="_Wqj88Lw9Eea83pW3ykw4Ew">Consultative Technical Selling Via Discovery – PoV – Customer Workshop</a>.
</p>
<p>
    Opportunities that fit within the Agile mode and are driven primarily by IBM Design Thinking and Agile delivery may
    require supporting architecture support for which TeamSD solutioning objectives (Explore and Develop activities)
    provide excellent guidance. In particular development of a Solution Outline for the architecture in advance of Playback
    0 via System Context, Architecture Overview and Architecture Decisions is strongly recommended. This gives us a great
    opportunity to start discussing the solution outline, its shape and style options, with the stakeholders very early in
    the process.
</p>
<h3>
    Reconciling Artifacts to be produced to support Solution Design
</h3>
<p>
    It is extremely rare for all of the potential set of artifacts for either IBM Design Thinking or TeamSD to be produced
    for an opportunity. It is important for the practitioner to determine the appropriate techniques to employ for a
    particular opportunity. Note that many techniques in both approaches require the output of one technique or task
    (artifact) as input to other techniques or task. This is frequently highlighted via an artifact dependency
    diagram.<br />
    A hallmark of TeamSD is the iterative manner in which work products are elaborated as the sales cycle progresses.
    Typically, only a high-level description and detail are needed to get client understanding and buy-in, that is then
    further elaborated to a level sufficient for the solution proposal and any technical reviews, and then continued to
    full elaboration during delivery.<br />
    When performing IBM Design Thinking techniques in support of Solution Design, consider the relationships between the
    type of information captured in the IBM Design Thinking artifact and the related TeamSD work products as shown below.
    What is revealed is a set of things that can be captured in multiple forms depending on the techniques used to capture
    the relevant content. Just as one shouldn’t be overly focused on work product form such as the document template used,
    one also should not be overly focused on which “form” / artifact is used to capture the content.

    <strong>Table 1 - Mapping IBM Design Thinking artifacts to TeamSD Work Products</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The IBM Design Thinking artifacts generally cover the key TeamSD Understand activity related work products as well as
    many of the TeamSD Explore activity work products (those dealing with Requirements and early Viability). The Understand
    activity work products that are not directly supported by the IBM Design Thinking artifacts are the IT System specific
    content such as detailed Technical Environment and Standards. In general, the IBM Design Thinking artifacts should
    suffice for TeamSD work product content associated with the Understand and Explore activities. Further, where possible,
    it is recommended to use IBM Design Thinking techniques and resulting artifacts to support TeamSD Understand and
    Explore activities. Note that Hills, representing high-level business use cases can then be refined or elaborated to
    create System and Technical use cases as and when appropriate. More detailed NFRs along with technical functional
    requirements and more project detailed viability assessment will be elaborated as part of the TeamSD Develop activity.
    In addition, the Standards and Technical Environment details will contribute to system design elements developed during
    the Explore and Develop activities.
</p>
<p>
    Another valuable view on artifact applicability is to visualize when specific artifacts appear within the CVM Sales
    cycle.

    Summary
</h3>Remember that TeamSD is an architecture method with focus across the complete sales lifecycle. The bulk of the
application of Architectural Thinking and associated guidance aligns with the Explore and Develop activities with
dependency on a strong understanding of the client needs and expectations. One of the key strengths of IBM Design Thinking
approach is the ability to discover innovative ideas that can deliver exceptional user experience and strong client value.</td>
