    There are several ways in which you can approach planning for Client Value. In each case the objective is to produce a
    plan that combines industry and technical insight and identifies IBM and partner capabilities to deliver associated
    value.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <em>Technical Account Planning</em>. Proactive planning on an annual basis, updated through the year.
    </li>
    <li>
        <em>Response to a Client Imperative</em>. Focused in a specific area that the client has prioritized.
    </li>
    <li>
        <em>IBM Thought Leadership</em>. Introducing new potential value from IBM capabilities.
    </li>
    <li>
        <em>Strategic Roadmap</em>. A longer term and higher level plan.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Note than in all cases, it is recommended that the Technical Account Plan be updated.
</p>
<h3>
    Technical Account Planning
</h3>
<p>
    If you are the Technical Sales leader for an IBM client, you are expected to produce a Technical Account Plan for your
    Client. This should be driven by the business and technology initiatives of the client together with your insights on
    where IBM technology can contribute to your client's success.
</p>
<p>
    You should consider all areas of the client's business in producing this plan and complement the overall plans produced
    by the IBM team (Client Value Account Plan) and the activities in Client Growth Strategic Planning (CGSP).
</p>
<h4>
    <font color="blue"><em>Scope</em></font>
</h4>
<p>
    The scope of the Technical Account Plan (TAP) is typically the enterprise - or at least a large part of it. The plan
    will contain multiple projects that the client will perform to move to the target architecture. Each project may then
    develop into a unique opportunity with a set of Team SD activities and tasks.
</p>
<p>
    The Technical Account Plan includes documentation of the client's current technical environment and the series of
    steps, or roadmap(s), required to transform a client from their current "as-is" environment to a "target" or "to-be"
    environment and associated set of capabilities. The term "roadmap" in this context is a series of projects undertaken
    by the client (with or without outside help) to progress a capability toward a target. The projects are linked together
    through dependencies on other projects. Together, the projects and dependency linkages form the roadmap. Here are some
    examples of the type of Information Technology capabilities that might be the target of the roadmap in a Technical
    Account Plan:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Application Development
    </li>
    <li>
        Cloud infrastructure
    </li>
    <li>
        Operational capabilities
    </li>
    <li>
        Analytics skills such as their ability to build a predictive analytic model.
    </li>
    <li>
        Implementing a DevOps strategy
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The duration of one of the projects in the roadmap may be measured in multiple weeks or months. If the roadmap projects
    together are too detailed they'll begin to resemble a project plan, which is not appropriate for this level of roadmap.
    Where there are multiple capabilities, it may be appropriate for a Technical Account Plan to have multiple roadmaps.
</p>
<h4>
    <font color="blue"><em>Developing a Technical Account Plan (TAP)</em></font>
</h4>
<p>
    Technical leaders in the sales team will typically prepare the roadmap as part of pre-sales technical strategy and
    planning activities. They will use the most appropriate tools depending on the capability domain. A common tool to use
    is a Maturity Model for a specific capability. The Assessment and Roadmap Tool / Technical Health Assessment (ART/THA)
    tool provides additional assistance with pre-loaded maturity models for certain IT capabilities.
</p>
<p>
    The early stages of a roadmap may be more detailed than the later stages. Think of an automobile trip from New York to
    the "west coast". The steps (projects) to get out of New York City will be quite detailed whereas the later steps may
    be dependent on unanswered questions ("do we want to go to the west coast of the US or Canada?") or will be influenced
    by new findings along the way ("Wow, it really does rain a lot of Seattle. It's nice here, but let's reconsider.").
</p>
<p>
    You can also apply agile thinking to the roadmap. Each early project should represent at least a Minimally Viable
    Product. Later projects can be thought of as "epics" in terms of their size and scope.
</p>
<h4>
    <font color="blue"><em>Alignment to Client Business and IT Initiatives</em></font>
</h4>
<p>
    A Technical Account Plan is also aligned to business initiatives, providing the technology required to support business
    processes via solutions from the core Systems of Record to Systems of Engagement or Analytics for Systems of Insight.
    This alignment is important as any transformation from "as-is" to "to-be" changes more than just the technology. It
    also changes the business processes and the organization. The Technical Account plan will focus on the technical
    capabilities and reference client information on business imperatives and changes planned for process or organization.
</p>
<p>
    A higher level Strategic Roadmap (see below) may be developed and provide a context, often multi-year, for the
    Technical Account Plan.
</p>
<p>
    The best practice is for the Strategic Roadmap to be a client deliverable that reflects a shared vision with IBM as a
    strategic partner. The diagram below shows the desired flow between the Strategic Roadmap, Technical Account Plan and
    relevant IBM value.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<h4>
    <font color="blue"><em>Tools and Techniques</em></font>
</h4>
<p>
    Many techniques can be used to develop either a Strategic Roadmap or the more specific capability roadmaps in a
    Technical Account Plan. These include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        A Component Infrastructure Roadmap (CIR) workshop provided by IBM services or pre-sales.
    </li>
    <li>
        An internal Assessment and Roadmap Tool / Technical Health Assessment (ART/THA) can also be used to produce a
        roadmap of IT capability transformation. That ART/THA workshop is typically run by the Client Technical Architect /
        Leader.
    </li>
    <li>
        The Business Innovation Architecture (BIA) technique, deriving insight from a Strategic Capability Network
        perspective.
    </li>
    <li>
        Enterprise Value Points (EVPs) are key strategic architectural components in our clients’ operations for which IBM
        can deliver a strong set of technical capabilities that support customer value.
    </li>
    <li>
        An Enterprise Architecture engagement commissioned by the client. Such an engagement could include business and
        organization as part of its scope (see the Alternatives section in this Task description).
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    Response to a Client Imperative
</h3>
<p>
    Use the Client Imperative artifact and complete the imperative definition section based on initial discussions with
    client sponsor. This will serve as a basis for identifying context and scope, interviewees and key questions. This may
    be derived from opportunity description in the Opportunity Plan if it is available. Add any other relevant content that
    is initially apparent to the remaining sections of the Client Imperative artifact. These sections will be refined and
    completed in a later task.
</p>
<p>
    If this opportunity originated with the client's interest in one of the IBM Blueprint's Industry Imperatives, the
    Client Imperative represents a specialization of the Industry Imperative, tailored to suit a specific client's needs.
    In such cases, information associated with the Industry Imperative may be helpful in documenting the client imperative.
</p>
<p>
    With the Client Imperative identified, consult IBM’s industry solutions portfolio and domain reference architectures
    for relevant material that can guide the production of a roadmap specific to this imperative. Follow the steps outlined
    below to produce a Strategic Roadmap that addresses the capability gaps you identify.
</p>
<h3>
    IBM thought leadership
</h3>
<p>
    Within the correct context, and backed by factual insight, a provocative point of view from IBM can be welcomed by a
    client. It takes judgment to know when your client is receptive to receiving this type of thought leadership. When
    preparing such a point of view be sure to consult with your colleagues who also serve the client to determine alignment
    with the client’s business and technical capability needs and which part(s) of the organization might be most receptive
    to the message.
</p>
<p>
    There are several resources one can exploit to develop a point of view for your customer. For a PoV that is focused on
    business capabilities there are general industry focused PoV templates available (see Industry Collaboration Hubs) as
    well as the structured technique discussed below, Business Innovation Architecture (BIA). For a PoV that is focused on
    IBM strategic capabilities consider a resource like the Enterprise Value Points discussed below.
</p>
<p>
    Such thought leadership should be specifically tailored for the needs and vernacular of your client and their
    organization. While it may address the adoption of a key technology or a response to a major industry trend, the
    insight you provide for Client Value must be in context of your client’s business and capabilities as captured in the
    <strong><em>Understand Business Environment and Objectives</em></strong> Task.
</p>
<h3>
    Strategic Roadmap
</h3>
<p>
    Where the planning for client value indicates that there is significant transformation involved in business and the
    supporting technology capabilities, consider producing a Strategic Roadmap which will summarize the set of initiatives
    required to achieve the full Client Value that is envisaged.
</p>
<p>
    The techniques used to develop a quality strategic roadmap vary based on the level and source of investment and must be
    evaluated in the context of the cost of sale. Having the client invest in an Enterprise Architecture consultancy
    engagement can result in the production of a very extensive strategic roadmap. Execution of the Business Innovation
    Architecture technique is another approach to creating a strategic roadmap. In addition there is a set of guidance
    papers focusing on the Client Imperative work product and deriving transformation initiatives and a Transformation
    Roadmap from a set of client imperatives.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>A Strategic Roadmap may have a multi-year scope, in which case it provides a higher level, strategic view for
    the Technical Account Plan.<br />

<p>
    While much of TeamSD is focused on a specific client initiative or opportunity, using IBM Solution Architecture method

<td class="sectionTableSingleCell"><p>
    Three alternatives are recommended below:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        IBM Enterprise Architecture method – focusing on a client’s business strategy and current business and technical
        capabilities.
    </li>
    <li>
        Business Innovation Architecture (BIA) technique – focusing on a client’s target business and technical
        capabilities.
    </li>
    <li>
        Enterprise Value Points (EVP) – focusing on matching key IBM strategic capabilities to a client’s target business
        needs.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>IBM Enterprise Architecture method</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The IBM Enterprise Architecture method is a proven approach for deep and thoughtful examination of the current and
    target state of a client’s Architecture capabilities in the Business, Information, Application, Infrastructure and
    Security domains. A full Enterprise Architecture can take several months of detailed effort, typically via a consulting
    engagement.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    An accomplished Enterprise Architect will have considerable experience in the production of Strategic
    Roadmaps.&nbsp;&nbsp; For broad scope planning or complex client imperatives, you should strongly consider engaging
    such skills.
</p>
<p>
    Existing enterprise architecture is an important influence on solution design. For additional guidance on this topic,
    see the associated <a href="./../../core.tech.presales.common.base-ibm_int/guidances/guidelines/role_of_ea_in_soln_design_8DBB0D23.html" guid="_9B8jEFo2EeCeD8_Z8azGSQ"><strong>Guideline: The Role of Enterprise Architecture in Solution Design</strong>.</a>
</p>
<p>
    The following are examples of enterprise architecture considerations that may apply when performing this task
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Application Function Model (ARC 302)</strong> The Application Function Model is helpful in identifying
        specific application function that requires change as a part of a Transformation Initiative.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Business Drivers (BUS 314)</strong> Business drivers may be helpful in understanding the motivation behind
        a particular client imperative and development of an appropriate solution strategy and associated transformation
        initiative.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Capability artifacts (BUS 316, 317 and 416)</strong> When the defined client imperative is related to
        business capabilities, these artifacts provide valuable insight when developing the solution strategy.<br />
        Capability resources will likely be closely tied to tactics defined in the solution strategy. The overall
        Capability Model Definition includes focus on the value proposition associated with a business capability. This may
        be helpful when defining the business benefits of the client imperative.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>Business Innovation Architecture technique</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Business Innovation Architecture (BIA) is a technique based on the concepts of consultative sales that brings business
    agility in pre-sales. BIA is an engagement model as opposed to a workshop model where the practitioner works with their
    customers on a regular basis. BIA is a universal technique and it can be applied in current situation as well as in any
    strategic shifts and disruptions because the focus of this technique is to drive business innovation for your customer.
</p>
<p>
    BIA has three key steps and an associated set of deliverables:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Preparation and Definition</strong> – This phase, which aligns with the TeamSD Understand Business
        Environment and Objectives task, focuses on producing an understanding of a customer’s target business
        capabilities. Typically four related deliverables are started during this phase: Strategic Capabilities Network
        (SCN), Capabilities Dashboard, Vocabulary and Capabilities Architecture.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Validation</strong> – In this phase the above deliverables are validated by both the customer and the IBM
        account team. Based on the feedback, the deliverables are further refined and elaborated. The information is also
        used to define a set of maturity models for customer and then construct an initial strategic roadmap.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Execution</strong> – the SCN, Capabilities Architecture, Maturity models and the roadmap become the input
        to the customer’s IT strategy and the validated IBM account plans. The Capabilities Dashboard is a valuable input
        to Technical Account Plan.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    For additional guidance on the BIA technique, see the associated <strong><a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../core.tech.presales.common.base-ibm_int/guidances/guidelines/business_innovation_architecture_80B93437.html" guid="_TyHkUGzAEeWMrbJJSftZog">Guideline: Business Innovation Architecture</a></strong>.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Enterprise Value Points</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The <strong>Enterprise Value Points (EVPs)</strong> offer an alternative approach to identify opportunities and drive
    growth in CAMSS. The EVPs are key strategic architectural components in our clients’ operations. They target points
    across the client’s business that they will be reliant upon – where important and lasting decisions are made. By
    securing an EVP we become essential to the client and as a result we can influence adjacent technologies and
    services.<br />
    <br />
    To get started, download the spreadsheet template and use it to assess your client. Then prioritize the EVPs to target
    and use the appropriate ‘What Matters’ point of view papers to develop the proposition to tackle a specific business
    need and decide who in the client to take it to.<br />
    <br />
    The EVP <em><u>'<strong>What Matters</strong>'</u></em> papers and assessment template are available at <a href="http://ibm.biz/TCGEVPs" target="_blank">ibm.biz/TCGEVPs</a>.
