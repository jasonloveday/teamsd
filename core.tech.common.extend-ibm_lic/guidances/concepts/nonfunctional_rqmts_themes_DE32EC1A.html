    The non-functional requirements for a business system address those aspects of the system that, whilst not directly
    affecting the functionality of the system, can have a profound effect on how that business system is accepted both by
    the users and the people responsible for supporting that system.&nbsp; These aspects cover a broad range of themes,
    ranging from how easy the system is to maintain once installed, to how quickly the individual transactions within the
    system can be executed.
</p>
<p>
    The major non-functional themes are listed below:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong><a href="#performance">Performance (including Capacity)</a></strong>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong><a href="#volumetrics">Volumetrics</a></strong>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong><a href="#scalability">Scalability</a></strong>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong><a href="#security">Security</a></strong>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong><a href="#regulatory">Regulatory Compliance</a></strong>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong><a href="#usability">Usability</a></strong>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong><a href="#maintainability">Maintainability (including Flexibility)</a></strong>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong><a href="#availability">Availability (including Recoverability and Reliability)</a></strong>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong><a href="#manageability">Manageability</a></strong>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong><a href="#environmental">Environmental (including Safety)</a></strong>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The requirements of the system to be delivered must be understood for each of these non-functional themes. Together
    with the functional requirements they define the baseline against which the business system must be designed. It is
    essential that both sets of requirements are captured during the initial stages of a project.
</p>
<p>
    Not every non-functional theme will apply to every project and the development of content related to any one theme may
    be developed in parallel, or in any sequence. While the individual themes are intended to be independent to some
    extent, it is likely that will need to be some level of balancing of concerns across the different themes based on the
    impacts changes in one will have on the feasibility and/or cost of implementing others.
</p>
<h3>
    <a id="performance" name="performance">Performance (including Capacity)</a>
</h3>
<p>
    Concerns captured by performance theme are related to how efficient and how fast the system is. Example:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Does the system respond fast enough to user actions
    </li>
    <li>
        Can the system support suitable number of concurrent users
    </li>
    <li>
        Can the system support enough transactional throughput
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    <a id="volumetrics" name="volumetrics">Volumetrics</a>
</h3>
<p>
    This requirement theme defines required size of the system, such as ability to store and process required volumes of
    particular data elements, or ability to support certain with number of user profiles. The volumetrics determine size of
    storage, memory that the system needs to support while sustaining throughput and performance targets. Some volumetrics
    are also used as configuration parameters of the system. For example a&nbsp;third party system may have a built in
    constraint on number accounts per user, max number of transactions per batch. Defining required values up front is
    helpful in identifying potential problems early.
</p>
<p>
    From a performance testing perspective, the volumetrics drive the size of the test data sets used during performance
    tests.
</p>
<h3>
    <a id="scalability" name="scalability">Scalability</a>
</h3>The scalability theme focuses on the ability of the system to be scaled effectively to handle changes in volume and
deliver greater throughput whilst still meeting an acceptable level of response. This is done by understanding how, over
the life of the business system; the overall workload is likely to grow (or occasionally lessen) from the current usage. 
<h3>
    <a id="security" name="security">Security</a>
</h3>IT security concerns relate to protecting confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information against security
risks. These high-level concerns are addressed through a variety of security controls which need to be incorporated in the
business system design and business processes.&nbsp; Security requirements are often a mix of both functional and
non-functional requirements, with those requirements being split between the Non-functional Requirements and Security &
Privacy Requirements artifacts.&nbsp; 
<h3>
    <a id="regulatory" name="regulatory">Regulatory Compliance</a>
</h3>Most regulatory compliance is predicated upon keeping accurate and reliable records of particular kind for a period of
time. If the business system is to be creating, storing or processing such records then a requirement for corresponding
functionality needs to be created. The confidentiality, integrity and availability of these records need to be protected
against IT security risks. That is why regulatory compliance concerns overlap with the IT Security discussed in previous
section. 
<h3>
    <a id="usability" name="usability">Usability</a>
</h3>The usability requirements reflect concerns about the ease of use and accessibility of the system. Usability of the
business system is determined largely by quality of its user interface. The usability is predicated on the responsiveness
of the user interface hence usability considerations lead to the requirements for performance â€“ particularly response time.
Other concerns relate to ergonomics, visual impact, structure, navigation, accessibility by people with disabilities. 
<h3>
    <a id="maintainability" name="maintainability">Maintainability (including Flexibility)</a>
</h3>Requirements relating to the theme of maintainability cover both the ability to make future enhancements to the system
or changes in the environment, as well as facilitating the discovery and correction of defects.&nbsp; Maintainablity is
tied difectly to serviceability in that it allows a system to be repaired or have updates performed in such a way as to
minimize the disruption of service of the application.&nbsp; 
<h3>
    <a id="availability" name="availability">Availability (including Recoverability and Reliability)</a>
</h3>
<p>
    The availability theme addresses the ability of the solution to provide it's expected services at a stated instant or
    over a stated period of time that reflects the overall readiness of the system. It is typically expressed as ratio of
    the proportion of time that the service is actually available for use by the customers within the agreed service hours.
</p>
<p>
    The reliability aspect focus on freedom from operational failure within an IT system. Reliability is the probability
    that an item will perform for a specified interval under stated conditions. Simply stated, it is how long the system
    can work.&nbsp; This differs from resilience which focuses on the ability of the system to continue working with faults
    in one or more components.
</p>
<p>
    Recoverability deals with what is required to restore services to an operational condition, usually in terms of time
    and expected functionality along with the what if any is an acceptable level of data loss.
</p>
<h3>
    <a id="manageability" name="manageability">Manageability</a>
</h3>
<p>
    This theme deals with&nbsp;systems management and operations aspects of the proposed solution.&nbsp; System management
    requirements may&nbsp;appear functional in nature, for example how should a component raise an exception to indicate
    business or technical failures, or may be constraints that are placed on the system, for example it is mandated that
    systems management software from a particular vendor must be used.
</p>
<h3>
    <a id="environmental" name="environmental">Environmental (including Safety)</a>
</h3>
<p>
    The environmental non-functional requirements theme typically focuses on the physical locations within which the system
    must operate and should include considerations for any unusual environmental conditions such as required cooling,
    vibration isolation or power concerns.
