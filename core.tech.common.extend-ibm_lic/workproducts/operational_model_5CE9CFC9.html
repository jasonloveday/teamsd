    This artifact provides:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        A definition of the operational aspect of the architecture of a particular IT system, designed to meet a specific
        set of functional and non-functional&nbsp; requirements. The "operational" aspect focuses on the IT system
        infrastructure.
    </li>
    <li>
        A definition of a pattern of how the operational aspect of the architecture of an IT system (or parts of it) may be
        constructed in order to satisfy a generalized set of functional and non-functional requirements. Examples may be
        found in IBM's architectural assets or in an enterprise's architecture framework.
    </li>
</ol>
<h4>
    For a particular IT system
</h4>
<p>
    This artifact may be used:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        As an input to architecture and design reviews, including confirmation that the business problem is well
        articulated and that there is a viable IT system.
    </li>
    <li>
        As a way of dividing large problems so that each part can be worked on in relative isolation.&nbsp; (For example, a
        Manufacturing system may be seen as composed of a Customer Information System, a Scheduling System and a
        Dispatching System. The operational aspect of each of these separate systems may then each be worked on
        separately).
    </li>
    <li>
        To enable application developers to modify and elaborate their work, based on this artifacts view of how the
        application will be distributed and managed.
    </li>
    <li>
        To enable the analysis of how the IT system will deliver key non-functional requirements such as performance &
        capacity, and security (confidentiality, integrity and availability), including the verification that the
        non-functional requirements of the nodes and connections are achievable.
    </li>
    <li>
        To contribute to estimates of the cost of the system's operational infrastructure, both for budgeting and as part
        of the business case for the solution.
    </li>
    <li>
        In conjunction with the functional aspect of the system, to help identify hardware and software technologies and
        products, and to generally be a blueprint for the acquisition, installation, and subsequent maintenance of the
        system
    </li>
    <li>
        As a detailed technical specification against which an architect can evaluate alternative products or technology
        vendors can submit tenders.
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    As a Pattern
</h4>
<p>
    As a pattern, this artifact may be used:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        To provide a "quick start" to projects, which can select, customize and integrate pre-developed, partial levels and
        views of this artifact as a "Reference Architecture".&nbsp; This can save time, reduce required project resources
        and reduce risk
    </li>
    <li>
        To control and constrain the options available to multiple and otherwise independent projects within an enterprise,
        in order to standardize, realize economies of scale, reduce costs and achieve higher levels of flexibility and
        interoperability across IT systems.
    </li>
</ul><p/><p>
    <strong>Note for pre-sale solution design (Team Solution Design users):</strong>&nbsp; In a pre-sale context this
    artifact&nbsp;typically serves the following purpose
</p>
<ul class="noindent">
    <li>
        To provide a preliminary view of the system for use in understanding customer requirements and general
        architectural approaches.
    </li>
    <li>
        To gain understanding of major elements of the IT system to be built such as primary system nodes, connections,
        locations, major components (including technical infrastructure) and existing assets to be reused.
    </li>
    <li>
        To gain an understanding of customer preferences and constraints.
    </li>
    <li>
        To develop a mechanism for early discussion regarding functional characteristics of the system by enabling basic
        design walkthroughs.
    </li>
    <li>
        To enable early analysis of nonfunctional requirements such as performance, availability and capacity, including
        confirmation of the viability of a solution through specification of the expected nonfunctional characteristics of
        nodes and components.
    </li>
    <li>
        To enable the evaluation and selection of products that could be used in the proposed system.
    </li>
    <li>
        To enable early estimates of the cost of the infrastructure to be used both for budgeting and as part of the
        business case for the solution.

    This artifact describes the operational distribution of a system's components (which may be grouped into deployment
    units) onto nodes, the placement of nodes and users across locations, the connections between nodes necessary to
    support the required interactions between components, in order to achieve the system's functional and non-functional
    requirements within the constraints of technology, skills and budget.
</p>
<h5>
    Operational Modeling Terminology
</h5>
<p>
    This artifact's (and that of its contained artifacts) terminology is defined within the System Description Standard R3
    Semantic Specification (see Guidance for link) which includes definitions for:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Actors (and workers) – the roles a user or an external system play with respect to the target system
    </li>
    <li>
        Locations – a geographical area or position.
    </li>
    <li>
        Borders – representing the existing connection between two locations
    </li>
    <li>
        Components - modular units of functionality, which make this functionality available through an interface.
    </li>
    <li>
        Deployment Units – a grouping of facets of a component that have similar characteristics.
    </li>
    <li>
        Connectors – enable the exchange of messages (interactions) between resource containers.
    </li>
    <li>
        Interactions – identify the messages exchanged between one or two resource containers in the context of a
        collaboration, and the sequencing of these messages via their associated send/receive events.
    </li>
    <li>
        Nodes - a collection of components fulfilling a specific responsibility with a certain quality of service within
        the target system.
    </li>
    <li>
        Connections - supports the required connectivity between connectable model elements.
    </li>
    <li>
        Zones – an aggregation of a number of model elements with a common (sub-) set of values for a particular
        non-functional requirement and/or non-functional characteristic.
    </li>
    <li>
        Boundaries - associated with a change in value for a particular non-functional requirement and/or characteristic
        between two model elements.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Depending on the development approach adopted and/or the context, it can be very helpful to create levels of this
    artifact.&nbsp; The two basic levels of this artifact are:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Logical</strong>:&nbsp; This level describes the characteristics and capabilities of the operational aspect
        of the system architecture in a <strong>technology independent and product neutral</strong> manner.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Physical</strong>:&nbsp; This level describes characteristics and capabilities of the operational aspect of
        the system architecture in a <strong>technology and product dependent</strong> manner.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Both levels of this artifact may be further described at three different sub-levels relating to the degree to which the
    level has been sized:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Unsized</strong> (or unranged) – the technology and products are specified to support the components
        deployed but not sized and without detailing how the system will achieve the service level characteristics.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Ranged</strong> – the technology and products are specified to support a bounded range of requirements for
        a defined range of circumstances.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Sized</strong> – the technology and products are specified and sized to support the components deployed and
        details how the system will achieve the service level characteristics.
    </li>

        An introduction, describing the overall context and content of the artifact, the nature of the artifact (either to
        meet a specific set of IT requirement or to provide a generalized architecture pattern), its scope and depth of
        detail, its level, and its degree of completeness.
    </li>
    <li>
        A description of the locations, borders, zones, and boundaries that provide the backdrop for the IT system.
    </li>
    <li>
        A model showing the placement of users of the IT system across locations and zones.
    </li>

    Levels of this artifact
</h5>
<p>
    The artifact can be a large and complex work product.&nbsp; It is therefore important to understand how it may be best
    developed and presented, depending on the particular context.
</p>
<p>
    In order to reduce the complexity of the development process, the various development techniques available take
    advantage of a number of well-defined views and levels of completeness.
</p>
<p>
    Therefore this artifact can be refined and elaborated in various ways depending on the nature of the project life cycle
    and the development techniques used.&nbsp; Useful intermediate stages of development have been defined for both the
    <strong>logical</strong> and <strong>physical</strong> levels of this artifact as described within this artifact.
</p>
<h5>
    Degree of completeness (elaboration) and quality (refinement)
</h5>
<p>
    Individual circumstances will dictate the degree of completeness (including omission) of each level of this
    artifact.&nbsp; Decisions on level of detail, focus and completeness will be based on many factors, such as
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Audience (e.g. business people, IT Architects, or Developers)
    </li>
    <li>
        Purpose (is it to be fully specified and configured or a generalized reference pattern?)
    </li>
    <li>
        Completeness (is it early in a project's life, or a finished artifact?)
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The degree of completeness reached (or required) will also be dependent on the development process (e.g. waterfall,
    iterative, etc.).&nbsp; The levels of this artifact elaborate through degrees of completeness towards their completed
    states while remaining synchronized and consistent with one another at each major project "milestone".
</p>
<h5>
    Varying depth of detail
</h5>
<p>
    As well describing the operational aspect of a complete IT system, it is often helpful to develop this artifact showing
    greater detail for particular parts of the system.&nbsp; For example:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        This artifact may model a whole IT system as one or two nodes on the overall model, but a further more detailed
        representation of parts of the IT system in a particular location may also be constructed.
    </li>
    <li>
        This artifact may model a single part of an IT system in detail without modeling the whole IT system.
    </li>
    <li>
        This artifact may include the same "recurring pattern" of nodes and/or connections, and, in this case, a separate
        artifact may detail the recurring pattern and be referenced by the main artifact.
    </li>
</ul>
<h5>
    Cross-cutting viewpoints
</h5>
<p>
    This artifact and the logical and physical levels of this artifact may be the focus of a particular viewpoint, at any
    degree of elaboration and refinement, to address the concerns of a particular stakeholder. These cross-cutting
    viewpoints overlap with one another.&nbsp; For example, views may be constructed on this artifact for:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Application
    </li>
    <li>
        Technical
    </li>
    <li>
        Performance
    </li>
    <li>
        Capacity
    </li>
    <li>
        Availability and Recovery
    </li>
    <li>
        Security and Privacy Management
    </li>
    <li>
        Operability and Operations Management
    </li>
    <li>
        Systems Management
    </li>
    <li>
        Software Distribution and Installation
    </li>
    <li>
        Distributed Data Management
    </li>
    <li>
        Problem Identification and Management
    </li>
    <li>
        End User Support/Helpdesk
    </li>
    <li>
        Networking
    </li>
    <li>
        Accessibility
    </li>
    <li>
        National Language Support
    </li>
    <li>
        Financial proprietary
    </li>
    <li>
        Archiving
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Such filtering does not generally change the elements in the artifact rather it simply enables a clearer focus on some
    particular part of it.

<h5>
    Linkages to other work products
</h5>
<p>
    As well as a linkage via Deployment Units with the functional aspect of architecture as embodied in the Component
    Model, this artifact has influences and/or is strongly interdependent on other areas that cover the design of the
    infrastructure that will implement the operational aspect of architecture. For example:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Network Design: affects the application design, middleware selection, component placement, security and privacy,
        systems management and overall operational system control.
    </li>
    <li>
        Platform Design; the detailed design and configuration of the platforms that will implement the nodes.
    </li>
    <li>
        Storage Design; the detailed design and configuration of storage which may be shared across multiple platforms.
    </li>
    <li>
        Site & Facilities Design; the detailed design and configuration of the site and facilities in the locations in
        which nodes (implemented by platforms) are placed.
    </li>
    <li>
        Systems Management design; through its definition of how the IT system is spread out over locations and what
        systems management components and nodes are needed at each location.&nbsp; Selection of a systems management style
        is an important decision, which determines: 
        <ul>
            <li>
                The cost of operations management
            </li>
            <li>
                The cost of software distribution
            </li>
            <li>
                The complexity of system management tooling
            </li>
            <li>
                Potential security and performance of the IT system (ability to satisfy the service level requirements)
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Existing or planned enterprise-wide IT infrastructure initiatives on which the target system will be
        implemented.&nbsp; For example, enterprise wide middleware decisions may well move function, which would otherwise
        be duplicated across multiple applications, into a set of shared services, which are usually purchased or part of
        an enterprise wide development effort.
    </li>
</ul><p/><p>
    <strong>Note for pre-sale solution design (Team Solution Design users):</strong>
</p>
<p>
    This artifact can typically be simplified in a pre-sale context and would typically contain the following.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        A&nbsp;Logical Operational View&nbsp;that shows the topology and geographic distribution of the system, the
        definition of the nodes (computer platforms) and network connections, and where and how users and external systems
        interact with the system being developed.
    </li>
    <li>
        A set of node descriptions. Each description will include a node description, applicable nonfunctional
        requirements, and an inventory of components (grouped as a deployment unit) that will be deployed on this node.
    </li>
    <li>
        Description of connections arranged as a table or matrix.
    </li>
    <li>
        For more complex systems, a table that depicts how deployment units (groups of components) map to specific nodes.
    </li>
    <li>
        A walkthrough description that illustrates typical system function for one or more key use cases.
    </li>
    <li>
        If appropriate, a description of the systems management strategy, including decisions about centralized vs.
        distributed managing stations, backup and recovery strategy, software distribution models and approach, change
        control, configuration management and other systems management processes.
    </li>
</ul>

    This artifact is the main description of an IT system's operational architecture. Without it, it becomes extremely
    difficult to design and develop an IT system of any complexity.
</p>
<p>
    The most obvious consequences will be that some functional requirements will be compromised and some non-functional
    requirements will not be met. Without this artifact, this is unlikely to be identified until very late in the project
    and either result in unexpected re-work which will impact the delivery schedule, or the system will fail to meet the
    desired service level characteristics, and will be more prone to system failures when put into operation.
