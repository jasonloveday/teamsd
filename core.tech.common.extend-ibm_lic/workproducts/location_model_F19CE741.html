    The purpose of this artifact is to provide a framework for the analysis, placement, deployment, and subsequent
    management of a system’s or enterprise’s elements such as business resources, systems, applications, data, networks,
    & other technology.
</p>
<p>
    This artifact may be used as an analysis tool in its own right. For example, it may be used to optimize the locations
    across which the business and IT operate. Or this artifact may be used as a backdrop to show visual representations and
    analyze the placement of business and IT resources.&nbsp; For example, the following may be mapped to this artifact;
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Business components, business activities, business roles, business processes, business functions, business users,
        business transaction volumes, financial metrics, actors, IT system infrastructure, networks, zones, and IT system
        transaction volumes.
    </li>
</ul>

    This artifact provides a model of locations and describes the locations’ characteristics and capabilities, and the
    relationships between locations.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    A <strong>location</strong> is a geographic place, such as: a user’s desk, a room, an office, a floor of a building, a
    building, a city, a country.
</p>
<p>
    This artifact represents all locations relevant to the project context including customer, supplier, business partner,
    agent, and other service provider locations.
</p>
<p>
    In the context of the operational aspect of the architecture of an IT system, the relationship between two locations
    defines the communication support between the locations and is expressed as a border.
</p>
<p>
    During the development of this artifact it may be useful to develop different defined levels of this artifact:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Logical</strong> – a classification (or a category) of geographic places where the business operates, based
        on the types of business activities that are performed at them.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Physical</strong> - a real place where the business has a presence.

    <li>
        A relationship diagram (or diagrams) showing the relative geographic positioning of locations, the relationships
        between locations, and showing the communication support between locations.

<th class="sectionTableHeading" scope="row">Notation</th><td class="sectionTableCell"><p>
    This artifact is defined using text, matrices and diagrams, i.e., in a "rich" picture.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    In many cases, this artifact will exhibit complex inter-relationships and communications which if drawn as a “box and
    line” diagram will exhibit crossing lines.&nbsp; A specialized notation should be used for the relationship diagrams
    facilitating a clear view of the support for communication between locations (expressed by “borders”), and to
    facilitate the overlay of other architecture elements of interest such as users, deployment units, nodes, and
    connections.
</p>

    The notation is defined by the IBM Architecture Description Standard Notation for Operational Model V2 and the IBM
    System Description Standard V3.<br />

    This artifact may be developed to different levels of detail and contain different content depending on the context in
    which it is being developed or used.&nbsp; For example, in the context of a business strategy project, this artifact
    may not contain a description of the borders.
</p>
<p>
    Locations may be nested - one location may contain another location. For example, a city may be defined as a location
    and then contain an office location, or a secure cabinet may be defined as a location within a machine room.
</p>
<p>
    A single office building may be defined as multiple locations – one for each floor of the building.

    supplier, partner, agent locations.

    In the context of IT systems development:
</h5>

    <li>
        It will be difficult to understand the physical requirements and constraints that need to be taken into account
        when developing an IT system, nor model and analyze the behavior of the IT components from a geographic perspective
        in order to achieve the IT system’s functional and non-functional requirements within the constraints of
        technology, skills and budget.
    </li>
    <li>
        It will be difficult to develop a view of the site and facilities management requirements and components, to plan
        site surveys and roll-outs, and to effectively plan training schedules for users.&nbsp;

<h5>
    In the context of business strategy, architecture and transformation:
