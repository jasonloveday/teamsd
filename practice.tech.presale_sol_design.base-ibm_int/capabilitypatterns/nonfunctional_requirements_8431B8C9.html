<th class="sectionTableHeading" scope="row">Main Description</th><td class="sectionTableCell"><p>
    Requirements of a system are typically classified as functional and non-functional requirements respectively.
    Non-functional requirements specify constraints and quality attributes that a system must meet along with its
    functional requirements.
</p>
<p>
    There is no universally accepted way of classifying a non-functional requirement from a functional one. However it is
    widely accepted that functional requirements specify “what” the system must do, whereas non-functional requirements
    specify restrictions, constraints or quality attribute values that the system must comply (or operate within) whilst
    meeting its “functional requirements”. Thus concerns about performance, availability, and other measurable system
    qualities are considered as non-functional requirements. However concerns about security, auditability, regulatory
    compliance, etc, can be traced to one or more functional requirements of the system, hence are regarded as functional
    requirements by some whereas non-functional requirements by others.
</p>
<p>
    The method adopts a working definition of NFRs as being any quality attribute, constraint and other “cross cutting”
    aspect of a system, which by itself is not a core function of the system, but qualifies how the system meets/delivers
    its core functions. In contrast the set of core functions of a system is considered as a functional requirement.
</p>
<p>
    Finally NFRs as described by this artifact treat the “system” as a “black box” and apply to external qualities of the
    “system” rather than internal system design. Often performance qualities are specified for internal system components
    by indicating performance “budgets” and which are treated as NFRs. However such activity is viewed as creation of a
    “Performance View” or “Performance Model” of the “System” using NFRs as inputs, rather than being NFRs.

    Non-functional&nbsp;requirements should be organized by a number of common themes or subcategories. These include the

    <li>
        When documenting these requirements, ensure that the needs of all stakeholders are represented.&nbsp; In
        particular, don't forget to include the needs of those responsible for maintaining or supporting the system once
        delivered.
    </li>
    <li>
        There are typically some overlaps and "gray areas" between these requirements and other requirements work
        products.&nbsp; For example, the authorization behavior of a system can be specified as use cases, or as statements
        within system-wide requirements.&nbsp; The overall driving need is that no important requirements are missed or
        duplicated and that there is an agreed approach for capturing and processing every type of requirement.
    </li>
    <li>
        Requirements originate from many places. Documenting the source of the requirement is particularly important when
        separating out externally mandated requirements.
    </li>
    <li>
        Requirements are often thought of as "Qualitative" (specifying a quality or desirable characteristic) versus
        "Quantitative" (specifying a quantity).&nbsp;&nbsp;Qualitative requirements can sometimes be elaborated into
        quantitative requirements.
    </li>
    <li>
        A good quality requirement is one that can be verified, either through testing or some other objective evaluation.
    </li>
    <li>
        These&nbsp;requirements should be evaluated for cost, schedule impact and level of contribution to business goals.
        They should be iteratively challenged, defended and amended based on this evaluation.
    </li>
    <li>
        While gathering and validating non-functional requirements, maintain Assumptions and Issues lists. 
        <p>
            Some activities will not give you satisfactory answers. This can be due to lack of information, or simply
            because you consider the answer threatens the viability of the design. Therefore, create two lists, and
            maintain them through the design study:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Any assumptions you make during the requirements and design process, including the rationale or thought
                processes behind those assumptions. Assumptions may be used to identify related subprojects or items of
                work, which are outside the scope of or after this project.
            </li>
            <li>
                Any major issues (significant concerns that could become show-stoppers).
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<blockquote style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px" dir="ltr">
    <p>
        The issues should be reviewed with the sponsor at the end of each phase. The assumptions need to be reviewed also,
        at the end of each phase, but the sponsor might not always be the correct person for the less important ones.
        Assumptions and issues apply to all work products, but are particularly common for non-functional requirements.

    <strong>Note for pre-sale solution design (Team Solution Design users):</strong> In a pre-sale context, this artifact
    documents important requirements of the proposed system such as performance and availability. If IBM services are part
    of the proposal, the implementation will require additional elaboration of this artifact to identify the various
    non-functional requirements and constraints. A non-functional requirement (NFR) is a quality requirement or constraint
    that a system (or some part of a system) must satisfy.&nbsp; The following categorization can be helpful in discussing
    NFRs:
</p>
<blockquote style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px" dir="ltr">
    <p>
        <br />
        Qualities may be runtime (or observable) or non runtime (not observable). Service Level Requirements (aka runtime)
        include: availability (scheduled, unscheduled), capacity (data, transactions, throughput, users, external systems),
        data integrity, manageability, performance, security or usability.&nbsp; Non runtime properties include:
        efficiency, maintainability, portability, reliability, safety and scalability.
    </p>
    <p>
        Constraints are usually imposed by the client and may be categorized as business or IT constraints.&nbsp; Business
        Constraint might be: administration and support, marketplace and external factors, organizational impact,
        regulation, risk threshold, schedule or budget.&nbsp; Examples of IT Constraints include: IT skills, IT systems,
        systems management, legacy integration, physical constraint, risk thresholds, standards or preferred vendors.
    </p>
    <p>
        Non-functional requirements are reflected as non-functional characteristics (NFCs) for various elements of the
        solution design.&nbsp; Non-functional requirements are independent of our solution design while non-functional
        characteristics are related to design elements based on our specific solution design.&nbsp; Each design element may
        have a pair of NFCs: required and supported.&nbsp; For example, the overall performance requirements for the
        proposed system might imply a required non-functional characteristic on a node of a .5 second response time. The
        solution proposed, based on our design choices, might then support a .4 second response time (in this case, the
        supported NFC exceeds the required NFC).
    </p>
    <p>
        These required NFCs might also be described in terms of their importance (or our level of commitment to meet them
        with our design).&nbsp; One possible way to do this is to use the MoSCoW classification scheme (see&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MoSCoW" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MoSCoW</a> for more
        information).&nbsp; That is:<br />
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            MUST (essential)
        </li>
        <li>
            SHOULD (important)
        </li>
        <li>
            COULD (nice to have and will be included if time and resources permit)
        </li>
        <li>
            WON'T (but WOULD be considered in the future)
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        A strength of this approach is that it not only describes what requirements are being addressed with the design but
        also what won't be delivered with the designed solution (or at least this release).&nbsp; In making sure that the
        requirements are very clearly articulated and agreed to, being clear about what is and what is not in scope can be
        very helpful.&nbsp;
    </p>

<p>
    The level of elaboration in pre-sale will depend on the complexity of the system, but even in the simplest situations,
    important requirements should be documented to ensure that the products and technology selected are suited to their
    purpose. In a pre-sale environment where there is substantial concern for functional requirements, it may be helpful to
    also use a specific requirements artifact.
