    The component model describes the structure of a system in terms of its software components with their
    responsibilities, interfaces, relationships, and the way they collaborate to deliver the required functionality. The
    component model is the main artifact documenting the functional view of the architecture and serves as an abstraction
    of the design. Components identified may be decomposed into further component models before they complete the
    specification required for detailed design.<br />
</p>
<p>
    Component models help define and document:<br />
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The structure of the system
    </li>
    <li>
        The recurring interactions and dependencies between sets of components
    </li>
    <li>
        The components present within an enterprise, each of which may be made up of smaller components.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Component models are documented at 2 levels:<br />
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The logical level - focuses on specifying the components' responsibilities and characteristics required to deliver
        the requirements. These specifications are technology and product neutral.
    </li>
    <li>
        The physical level -focuses on how to implement the components to meet the previously established specifications.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    You may transform logical components into physical components via custom development, the purchase of products, or the
    reuse of assets.<br />
</p>
<p>
    It may be important to maintain a separation between logical and physical components on larger projects. However,
    smaller or less complex projects may evolve a single logical component model into a physical model, and end up with
    only a physical model.<br />
</p>
<p>
    Examples of components at the logical level are a 'Message Bus' or a 'Customer Relationship Manager' component.
    Components at the physical level that implement these logical components might be 'IBM WebSphere Message Broker' or
    'Siebel Contact Center.'<br />
</p><p/><p>
    The Subsystem sits at the transition point between business and IT aspects. Subsystem analysis validates and completes
    the mapping of high level business functions to high level IT functions that started during Functional Area
    Analysis.&nbsp;&nbsp;A Subsystem represents a large-grained organizing&nbsp;construct that provides logical grouping of
    functions and functionally-cohesive, business aligned services.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    During this process of elaboration, mapping is taken from the subsystem level down to the service component
    level.&nbsp; Service components identified during Subsystem Analysis are elaborated and specified during Component
    Specification. Service Components are initially associated with subsystems that are functionally aligned with business
    domain functional areas. This relationship provides traceability and justification for their inclusion in the solution.
</p>
<p>
    A Service Component is a large grained unit that acts as a container of functionality provided by functional and
    technical components. A characteristic of Service Components is the use of several key design patterns: façade,
    composite, mediator and rule objects.
</p>
<p>
    Services used in an SOA based solution are realized through Service Components which belong to a specific business
    function aligned subsystem. Each Service Component will have the responsibility of ensuring the QoS of the services it
    will realize. As an enterprise-scale asset, each Service Component qualifies for funding, governance and maintenance
    associated with it. Infrastructure management must be in place to ensure availability, load balancing, security,
    performance, versioning and overall health of the Service Component that will be responsible for implementing the
    functionality of a set of services and ensuring its quality of service. Functional components and technical components
    can be used across several Service Components.
</p>
<p>
    In an SOA project, this artifact progresses through a more detailed elaboration of the model that originated with the
    subsystem analysis. Key differentiating aspects of the service Component Model are the use of the Enterprise Component
    pattern in the elaboration of Service, Functional and Technical Components, and a technique that focuses on concise
    modeling at the component level.

    Subsystems are described in terms of responsibilities, composition, behavior, interfaces, and relationships between
    subsystems. The internal composition of subsystems is described by identifying the Service Components, Functional
    Components, and Technical Components that each subsystem will contain. These elements are described in several ways
    using a combination of UML diagrams and textual descriptions. Subsystems provide bridge from a business function view
    to an IT function view.&nbsp; The figure below shows a typical subsystem relationship diagram:

<div class="sectionContent">
<table class="sectionTable" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td class="sectionTableSingleCell"><p>
    Points to consider when deciding whether to use a Component Model:<br />
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        A Component Model is useful when you must design the system for multiple target environments, with separate design
        architectures. The Component Model is an abstraction, or a generalization, of the system design. It omits most of
        the details of the design in order to provide an overview of the system's functionality.
    </li>
    <li>
        The Component Model provides value when the design is complex, such that new team members need a simplified,
        abstracted model to understand it. A well-defined architecture can serve the same purpose.
    </li>
    <li>
        Balance the extra work required to ensure that the component and design models remain consistent against the
        benefit of having a view of the system that represents only the most important details of how the system works. It
        can be very costly to maintain a high degree of fidelity between the Component Model and the system design. A less
        ambitious approach might be to maintain the Component Model with only the most important components and the key
        abstractions in the design. As the complexity of the Component Model increases, so does the cost to maintain it.
    </li>
    <li>
        Once you no longer maintain the Component Model, its value decays rapidly. At some point, it no longer accurately
        reflects the current functional design of the system. Deciding to no longer maintain the Component Model may be
        appropriate, as it may have served its purpose, but the decision should be a conscious one.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Component models tend to be useful in companies where systems live for decades, or where there are many variants of the
    system.<br />
</p>
<p>
    To ensure the successful development of a component model on a project, your team should:<br />
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Create a stable and coherent structure
    </li>
    <li>
        Focus on the right levels of abstraction
    </li>
    <li>
        Develop relationship and interaction diagrams in parallel
    </li>
    <li>
        Select architecturally significant requirements as inputs to the Component Model
    </li>
    <li>
        Plan how your team will leverage the Component Model throughout the project lifecycle
    </li>
</ul><p/><p>
    <strong>Note for pre-sale solution design (Team Solution Design users):</strong>&nbsp; In a pre-sale context,&nbsp;the
    Component Model&nbsp;illustrates the basic ideas of the proposed architecture but may be substantially less elaborate
    than it will be&nbsp;during later design phases. This&nbsp;artifact includes guidance tailored to the pre-sale
    environment. In a pre-sale context the following elements of the component model are recommended. More complex
    situations may require more elaboration. For more complex situations, Team Solution Design users may opt to use the
    SA4TeamSD configuration of IBM's Rational System Architect tool to develop the required elements of the Component
    Model. For guidance on the adoption and use of System Architect (SA4TeamSD), refer to the associated tool mentor.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Component Description:</strong> As general guidance, at a high level, components depict the major
        subsystems and boundaries&nbsp;and interfaces&nbsp;of the overall system. Later they can be decomposed or
        refactored as necessary. Components are often built or acquired as a cohesive unit, separate in some way from other
        components. <strong>System Architect</strong> includes the ability to model&nbsp;and describe various aspects of
        components.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Component Relationship Diagram:</strong> This diagram&nbsp;is a static view which shows the organization of
        and dependencies among a set of components. This diagram will indicate where interfaces must exist.&nbsp;SA4TeamSD
        users&nbsp;can create this diagram using the Logical or Physical Relationship View. This view is typically based on
        a using relationship where one component depends on another based on using an interface that is offered.
        SA4TeamSD&nbsp;also offers Logical and Physical Structure Views which&nbsp;depict component relationships based on
        the sum of all messages flowing between components. &nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Component Interaction Diagram:</strong> This diagram is based on the UML Sequence Diagram which is a kind
        of UML Interaction Diagram. It emphasizes the ordering of messages between components to execute some particular
        scenario. This is helpful in a pre-sale context to understand important functions of the proposed system. The
        pre-sale level of elaboration should focus on the most important or least well understood
        interactions.&nbsp;<strong>System Architect</strong> users will create this diagram using the Logical Sequence
        View. An alternative is the Logical Collaboration View.<br />

    It is difficult to gain an understanding of the structure of a complex system without some kind of component
    model.<br />
</p>
<p>
    The absence of this artifact may result in:<br />
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Difficulty managing the development project&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        The need for individual designers and developers to understand most of the inner details of the entire system&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        Difficulty managing parallel development due to imprecise definitions of the work allocated to development groups
    </li>
    <li>
        Missed opportunities for reuse of high level components&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        An incomplete design with key design elements missing
    </li>
    <li>
        Lack of information (such as the relevant service level requirements) essential to the appropriate placement of
        applications and data across the system infrastructure
    </li>
    <li>
        Difficulty tracing requirements through to implementation and validating that the architecturally significant
        requirements are realized in the executable architecture<br />
    </li>
</ul><p/><ul>
    <li>
        Failure to identify and utilize service components can lead to realization of services through suboptimal design
        techniques that can limit both the initial and long term viability of the service&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        Failure to apply the Enterprise Component pattern can lead to a suboptimal non-standard design that may increase
        the coupling between service consumer and provider, a very undesirable outcome for an SOA based solution
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    An additional objective of SOA based initiatives is to achieve business alignment of the IT solution, which is in part
    represented by the mapping of functional areas to subsystems as depicted in early elablorations of this artifact.
    Failure to carry out subsystem analysis can negatively impact the ability to meet this objective for several reasons:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Business domain may not be clearly mapped to the IT solution through decomposition into high level subsystems,
    </li>
    <li>
        Large grained grouping of functionality may not exist, leading to increased system and business complexity
    </li>
    <li>
        An appropriate container for service, functional and technical components may not exist, complicating later design,
        development and deployment related activities.
    </li>
</ul></td>

<th class="sectionTableHeading" scope="row">Reasons for not needing</th><td class="sectionTableCell"><p>
    A Component Model may not be necessary when:<br />
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The overall system to be developed is quite small
    </li>
    <li>
        The functional view of the overall system can be adequately described in some other form, as may be the case with a
        simple package-based organization of the architecture<br />
    </li>
</ul></td>

<tr valign="top">
<th class="sectionTableHeading" scope="row">Representation Options</th><td class="sectionTableCell"><p>
    Ideally, you should represent component models using a UML modeling tool that supports the UML 2 notation defined for
    this artifact. Modeling tools help ensure consistency between models and between the various diagrams they contain by
    allowing model elements to be shared among many models or diagrams. These tools also allow multiple views of the same
    model.<br />
</p>
<p>
    Alternatively, you can represent component models through a series of stand-alone diagrams developed in diagramming
    tools, then bound together within a word-processing document. A diagramming tool is difficult to maintain if any model
    element appears in multiple diagrams, as changes to the model element must be made in each diagram on which it appears.
    These tools may be appropriate for smaller projects in which the development and maintenance of the component model is
    limited in scope, resources and effort. However, this approach is impractical for a team of practitioners responsible
    for maintaining an up-to-date component model that interoperates with other models, such as the requirements and
    operational models.<br />
</p>
<p>
    Whichever option you choose, do not underestimate the importance of using a common notation and standard like UML 2.
    All diagrams, irrespective of representation option, should use formal notation, and UML 2 is recommended.<br />
