    The main purpose of a <b>Subject Area Model</b> Work Product is to:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Convey, graphically or textually, the scope of an enterprise, a desired capability or application from the point of
        the view of the data or information required to support the enterprise, application or capability.
    </li>
    <li>
        Provide parameters and boundaries for subsequent data analysis and data design activities. These boundaries may
        also impact subsequent architectural decisions.
    </li>
    <li>
        Provide high-level planning constructs with respect to the data / information needs for the capability, application
        or enterprise.
    </li>
    <li>
        To enable and support a proper alignment between the key information requirements of the enterprise, capability or
        application with the goals and objectives of the same.
    </li>
    <li>
        To enable consultants and senior management to explore the constraints on the business and opportunities for, and
        implications of change.
    </li>
    <li>
        To provide a useful vehicle for communication of the information and to encourage client ownership, acknowledgement
        and acceptance of the information presented.
    </li>
    <li>
        Develop a document around a set of information that represents the consensus built by customer stakeholders.
    </li>
    <li>
        Provide input into a detailed release plan and project estimates for a subsequent development effort.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    This work product also represents a hand-off point between various IBM competency groups. For example, it is hoped and
    anticipated that an Industry Solution Unit (ISU) or Customer Relationship Management (CRM) practice might work with a
    customer to develop their core value propositions, capability models, and capability enablers. At some point, however,
    in the identification of capability enablers, there may be a realization that one or more of the enablers suggests a
    Business Intelligence (BI) (or Electronic Document Management (EDM) or E-business) solution. If the <b>Subject Area
    Model</b> work product is within the scope of the consulting engagement, it is appropriate to engage a qualified
    competency SME (i.e. BI practitioner, or EDM or E-business SME) to join the team. If not, the <b>Subject Area Model</b>
    work product represents the starting point for a consulting engagement in which a BI (or EDM or E-business) competent
    practitioner would document the information areas specific to enabling the BI (or EDM or E-business) value proposition.
</p><p/><p>
    <strong>Note for pre-sale solution design (Team Solution Design users):</strong>&nbsp; In a pre-sale context, the
    primary&nbsp;purpose of this artifact is to identify required subject areas, related data items, candidate data sources
    and additional solution requirements that will result from the analysis of these data sources. Understanding of subject
    areas will be helpful in defining the responsibilities of components.

communication vehicle for an executive or business management audience. This work product is generally developed in
parallel to work products that document a high-level vision of a solution. While other work products focus on the
processes, organization or technology which needs to be developed or enhanced or purchased, the <b>Subject Area Model</b>
work product focuses on the data which must be present in order to enable an enterprise, a capability or an application.<p/><p>

<table class="sectionTable" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td class="sectionTableSingleCell"><p>
    The development of the <b>Subject Area Model</b> work product depends greatly on two key skills, 1) industry/functional
    subject matter expertise and 2) facilitation experience. For example, a customer whose primary product is women’s
    apparel, whose main distribution method is through catalog sales, and whose business intelligence interest is centered
    around controlling costs and increasing the average purchase quantity and total dollar amount per order, would need an
    industry subject matter expert on the project team who is familiar with the main drivers of cost control and customer
    buying habits in this environment. Facilitation skills are important because it is a primary technique used to engage
    the customer in articulating their information needs and the decisions the desired information needs to support.
</p>
<p>
    A third, but less important skill dependency for the development of this work product is data analysis or data modeling
    skill.
</p>
<p>
    A significant and essential by-product of the development of this work product is the consensus built around the
    results. By inviting input from all stakeholders with an interest in the enablement of a defined capability, and by
    leading them all through a structured and impartial process for the rational identification of related subject areas,
    the consultant achieves the ‘buy-in’ to the scope of the application or capability.
</p>
<p>
    Depending on the level of detail available as input into the activities to develop this work product, the project team
    may have to iterate several times through steps 3 and 4 of the development approach outlined above.
</p>
<p>
    This work product is typically developed as a graphical representation of the subject area groupings. Sometimes known
    relationships between groupings of information are noted. Textual information is typically a description of each
    subject area.
</p>
<p>
    The <b>Subject Area Model</b> work product is generally packaged into a major consulting engagement deliverable by
    combining its content with the results of other work products. Because it does not make sense to discuss or develop
    subject area information without a target application or capability in mind, this work product cannot stand on its own
    without this other information.
</p>
<p>
    The <b>Subject Area Model</b> work product requires a subsequent analysis and design effort to justify its benefits. If
    the client appears unable, unwilling or unlikely to proceed beyond a capability definition engagement, this work
    product may be postponed.
</p>
<p>
    A critical by-product of this work product is the client consensus built around the scope of the application or
    capability.
</p>
<p>
    This work product is more fully developed as a logical data model and physical data model in subsequent iterations of
    the requirements definition process.
</p>
<p>
    This work product should be developed at the appropriate level of granularity for its scope and purpose. For example,
    if the scope of the information analysis is at the enterprise level, then the subject area model should reflect an
    enterprise view.
</p>
<p>
    The scope of this work product should validated as early in the development cycel as possible, especially as it relates
    to the identified stakeholder groups whose input will for the basis of the results.&nbsp; Make sure that the client
    stakeholder groups and client executive management agree to the results documented in the work product and can
    articulate the value of the process used to develop the results.
</p>
<p>
    Verify the client understand the purpose of and why the subject are model needs to be produced and the client
    understands:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        What it represents, how it was developed and its importance in guiding subsequent development work
    </li>
    <li>
        That it is perceived as a 'guiding' document to be referred to and developed more fully in subsequent iterations of
        the requirements definition process
    </li>
    <li>
        The risk inherent in not developing this work product
    </li>
    <li>
        The limts of the subject area model and that its main purpose is to develop a general application or capability
        scope
    </li>
    <li>
        The skills required to develop this work product in the event they wish to assume ownership of its maintenance in
        the future.
    </li>
</ul><p/><p>

    <li>
        There is no basis for partitioning the organization’s data and scoping subsequent projects.
    </li>
    <li>
        There is a danger of missing important information needs and its implications.

    <li>
        Some key functional requirements related to missing subject area groupings may not be identified.
    </li>
    <li>
        An assessment of information sharing requirements, across business units or functional areas, is not possible.

    <li>
        An incomplete picture of an organization’s (or capability’s or application’s) needs may result in erroneous
        recommendations regarding the development of some solution areas.

</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The client organization or another vendor or another IBM consulting organization has formulated this information
