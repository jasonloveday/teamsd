<td class="sectionTableSingleCell"><p>
    <a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/software/solutions/soa/" target="_blank">Service Oriented Architecture (SOA)</a> is an
    architectural style that has become increasingly important for the design of business solutions. SOA requires a service
    provider, service requestor and typically some form of mediation. The architectural principles of SOA (encapsulation,
    loose coupling, reuse and composability) are well established while the programming model has continued to evolve.
</p>
<p>
    There is a rapidly increasing set of SOA Services (typically REST-based) that are available in the marketplace for
    Cloud-based services - whether for Infrastructure, Platform or Application level. The adoption of Cloud technology has
    rapidly accelerated the availability of Service APIs from Service Providers and is based on SOA principles. <em>In this
    task, where SOA Services are referenced, they refer to both Enterprise-based (internal) SOA Services and those Services
    from a Cloud-based Service Provider.</em>
</p>
<p>
    The consideration of SaaS based SOA services should be indicated in the Candidate Asset List which is an input to this
    task. For more information on SaaS considerations, consult the <a href="./../../process.tech.teamsd.base-ibm_int/guidances/whitepapers/saas_and_teamsd_6537251B.html" guid="_YJrn4AUtEeWswdxiRhBPbg"><strong>White Paper on SaaS and TeamSD</strong></a>
</p>
<p>
    As described in the <a href="./../../core.tech.presales.common.base-ibm_int/guidances/guidelines/soa_design_for_team_solution_design_2826F5FF.html" guid="_t4Bw0PqoEdyBdP2Q1C9JPg"><strong>Guideline: Service Oriented Architecture Design for Team Solution
    Design</strong></a>, there are many client projects that involve SOA but don't require the identification and
    realization of services. In other cases, considerable effort will be required to identify existing and candidate
    services. To account for these differences, the steps required in this task will vary based on the following
    considerations.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Are any new SOA services required?
    </li>
    <li>
        Is the pre-sale engagement IT or business driven?
    </li>
    <li>
        If new SOA services are required who will be responsible for the design and realization?
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Based on the answer to these questions, IBM’s post-sale role may range from infrastructure provider to leading the
    design and realization of new SOA services. Most situations can be represented by one of the following three scenarios.
    By selecting the scenario that most closely applies, you will be able to select the most appropriate steps in this
    task.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Scenario 1 - Likely proposal: IT driven / additional SOA infrastructure only / no new SOA services<br />
    </strong>In scenario 1, the expected outcome is a proposal for additional SOA infrastructure to support an existing SOA
    environment. Creation of new services is not anticipated and IBM SOA design services will not be required. A scenario 1
    opportunity is typically driven by the client’s IT organization. If the requirements for the new SOA infrastructure can
    be developed without knowledge of existing services, it will not be necessary to execute any of the steps in this task.
    In this case, simply refer to associated Guideline: Service Oriented Architecture Design for Team Solution Design for
    guidance on how Team Solution Design tasks and work products work together in an SOA solution. In other cases, you may
    need to discover SOA services already existing in the client's SOA infrastructure that are to be reused. Basic
    information about the relevant services will be captured to enable design of the additional SOA infrastructure. The
    purpose of identifying these existing services would be to serve as a basis for determining infrastructure requirements
    and to support illustration and explanation of the proposed architecture.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Scenario 2 - Likely proposal: IT driven / new SOA infrastructure / new SOA services / client responsible for
    SOA services design and realization</strong><br />
    In scenario 2, the expected outcome is a proposal for new or additional SOA infrastructure with new SOA services to be
    designed and implemented by the client, perhaps with assistance from others such as IBM SWG Services or a non-IBM
    services provider. A scenario 2 opportunity is typically driven by the client’s IT organization. As a Technical
    Solution Architect, in this task, you will need to identify new SOA services as part of the pre-sale activity. Similar
    to scenario 1, the purpose of identifying these new services would be to serve as a basis for determining
    infrastructure requirements and to support illustration and explanation of the proposed architecture. In addition these
    new candidate services could serve as a basis for a pre-sale demonstration or proof of concept.
</p>
<p>
    This scenario results in identification of a limited set of services with limited elaboration and realization. The
    level of detail required will vary, with more detail required to support a custom demonstration or proof of concept.
    Consequently, it is important that if the client will be responsible for post-sale SOA services design and realization
    efforts, the client also has sole responsibility for estimation of the design and realization effort.
</p>
<p>
    Refer to the associated <strong><a href="./../../core.tech.presales.common.base-ibm_int/guidances/guidelines/soa_design_for_team_solution_design_2826F5FF.html" guid="_t4Bw0PqoEdyBdP2Q1C9JPg">Guideline: Service Oriented Architecture Design for Team Solution Design</a></strong>
    for additional guidance on how Team Solution Design tasks and work products work together in an SOA solution.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Scenario 3 - Likely proposal: Business driven / new SOA infrastructure / new SOA services / IBM responsible for
    SOA services design and realization</strong><br />
    In scenario 3, the expected outcome is a proposal for additional SOA infrastructure with IBM responsible for the design
    and implementation of new SOA. In this scenario, the Technical Solution Architect will typically request assistance
    from an SOA SME rather than execute the steps in this task. Consider the following capabilities for use in this
    scenario.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Cloud Advisory services for insight on available services relevant to the client’s industry and specific
        initiative.
    </li>
    <li>
        The Service Oriented Modeling and Architecture (SOMA) method provides in-depth guidance on how to move from the
        business models created through CBM or similar business analysis techniques, to the models required by a SOA
        solution design. A SOMA workshop (sometimes referred to as "SOMA-lite") can be used to begin this process. This
        workshop might be used pre-sale or, more likely, to kick off a SOMA services engagement.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    In scenario 3, it is very important that a SOA SME be involved in the pre-sale activity if the proposal is expected to
    contain details or estimates of the post-sale design activity. Even though a SOA SME may lead the SOA services aspect
    of the solution the Technical Solution Architect may still use Team Solution Design to develop other aspects of the SOA
    solution (for example, the SOA infrastructure and architecture). In this case, refer to associated <a href="./../../core.tech.presales.common.base-ibm_int/guidances/guidelines/soa_design_for_team_solution_design_2826F5FF.html" guid="_t4Bw0PqoEdyBdP2Q1C9JPg"><strong>Guideline: Service Oriented Architecture Design for Team Solution

</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Domain Decomposition: a top-down business-driven decomposition of a business domain, from the business aspect to IT
        aspect as shown in the figure below. Note that when a Component Business Model exists, CBM competencies can be
        treated as domains.&nbsp;<br />

    </li>
    <li>
        Existing Asset Analysis: a bottom-up analysis that examines assets such as existing custom, packaged applications,
        and industry models, to determine what can be leveraged to realize service functionality.&nbsp; These existing
        assets might already contain existing services or might help us identify new services.
    </li>
    <li>
        Goal-Service Modeling: an analysis that starts with Business goals that are decomposed into sub-goals and
        supporting services. Key performance indicators and associated metrics are identified to measure the attainment of
        sub-goals through the services identified.&nbsp; Goals, sub-goals, and key performance indicators may have already
        been captured in Project Definition.&nbsp;

    Even though a SOMA engagement might not be proposed, it is useful to understand some of the essentials of SOMA. The <a href="./../../core.tech.presales.common.base-ibm_int/guidances/whitepapers/soma_essentials_for_team_solution_design_44DB24E5.html" guid="_ZA1ggPqdEdyBdP2Q1C9JPg"><strong>Whitepaper: Understanding SOMA Essentials for Team Solution Design</strong></a>
    was created for this purpose. As described in this whitepaper, SOMA activities are grouped into three major steps:
    Identification, Specification and Realization Decisions. In the full SOMA method, these major steps are accomplished
    through multiple tasks which create various sections of the Service Model. In Team Solution Design, you will use a
    single task with multiple steps. The resulting work product will create a subset of sections required by the full work
    product. Each section will typically also be less elaborate than required in a post-sale engagement. The necessary
    number of sections and level of elaboration will depend on several factors, including which of the above scenarios is
    appropriate and the complexity of the expected proposal.<br />
    <br />
    One final note for pre-sale solution designers (Team Solution Design users): As mentioned above, occasionally, we will
    develop one or two services as part of a Proof of Concept.&nbsp; In these cases, we will limit our PoC scope (and
    investment) to only what is required to prove our capability.&nbsp; For example, we might "stub out" parts of the
    service (like access to backend applications or data sources) that are already well known.&nbsp; For this reason, these
    services created for a PoC are rarely usable in production without further development.&nbsp;
