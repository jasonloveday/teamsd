    <strong>Executive Summary</strong>
</p>
<p>
    This is an introduction to a very successful technical selling approach that focuses on collaborating with the business
    client to identify one or more compelling business scenarios and associated solution(s). The technique involves
    incremental commitment by the client through their investment in a set of collaborative activities.

    <strong>&nbsp; Figure 1: High Level Approach including Discovery, PoV and Workshop Activities</strong>
</p>
<p>
    This technique logically involves 3 phases as called out in its name: Discovery, PoV, and Customer Workshop.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Discovery</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The Discovery phase involves investment by the IBM Client team to collect as thorough an understanding about the
    Customer as possible. There are many sources of information and assets available to draw upon, particularly at the
    Industry or Market Segment level. As part of the guidance for Discovery, a set of Market Segment “MindMaps” are being
    created and maintained in a TeamSD <a href="http://ibm.biz/DiscoveryMindMaps" target="_blank"><u>Guidance Asset
    Wiki</u></a>. Each MindMap presents a common structure that organizes the type of information to be gathered
    (discovered) along with links to assets and repositories that can support the effort. These MindMaps are most
    prescriptive for the “outside-in” types of knowledge. For the deeper, client specific content, you will need to draw
    upon the historic IBM-Client relationships owned by various members of the IBM Client team.
</p>
<p>
    Discovery focuses on all aspects of the Client that impacts our understanding, from industry trends and challenges,
    specific business needs and initiatives, business financial and competitive position, organizational drivers and
    current technical environment. The market segment – persona specific MindMaps are crowd sourced. Thus the Technical
    Solution Architect not only can refer to one or more specific MindMaps to accelerate and organize your team’s Discovery
    activity, but you can also update existing MindMaps with valuable links and assets you have discovered and/or create a
    derivative MindMap that focuses more closely on the “buyer persona” and “market segment” associated with your Client.
</p>
<p>
    The purpose of Discovery is to have the data necessary to formulate a quality set of business scenarios that if
    properly addressed through one or more solutions could deliver significant business value to the Client. The assessment
    of candidate business scenarios and the packaging of a story to deliver to the Client for validation is the focus of
    the PoV phase.<br />
    <br />
    <strong>Point of View (PoV)</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The overall objective of the Customer Point of View (PoV) document is to provide a very compelling business-oriented
    recommendation for customers regarding a specific business problem. The PoV is expected to be a discussion starter and
    a door opener to pursue further discovery and validation activities with customers. Moreover, the PoV should be used to
    influence elements of client’s strategy that are related to the area of the PoV, e.g. Retail Industry-&gt;Customer
    Experience. Influencing customer's opinion can be achieved through many channels. One the most effective methods is to
    provide customers with an innovative vision on how some sections of their business can be transformed by the
    incorporation of major disrupting forces and technologies to their organizations to produce innovative and exciting
    user experiences that will lead to better results.
</p>
<p>
    The PoV will be delivered to a targeted [set of] buyers at your client. The business value proposition needs to be
    expressed in terms of KPI that are relevant to these buyers. The IBM client team expects that the delivery of the PoV
    provides a level of validation from the customer of IBM’s understanding of their critical issues and the potential
    value of partnering with IBM to address these issues.<br />
    To aid in the creation of an effective PoV, there is guidance in the form of a guidance paper and a set of sample PoVs.
    Armed with a strong set of information from the Discovery phase, the assessment and generation of insight needed to
    create an effective PoV should be straightforward. Note, the overall process may be iterative. The initial
    prioritization of customer issues focused on in a specific PoV might not resonate or be validated by the customer, in
    which case further assessment may be needed and different PoV(s) generated and floated by the customer.
</p>
<p>
    The end goal of a successful PoV is a client that is interested enough in the potential of further collaboration with
    IBM that they are willing to invest in a collaborative workshop (Customer Workshop) to identify and prioritize serious
    candidate opportunities to pursue. These in turn would be a [potential set of] qualified opportunities. A detailed
    approach and technique for building a Customer Point of View is presented in the Whitepaper&nbsp;<a class="elementLink" href="./../../../practice.tech.presale_sol_design.base-ibm_int/guidances/whitepapers/how_to_build_a_cust_pov_CECBC05B.html" guid="_F0haoLxCEea83pW3ykw4Ew">How to Build a Customer Point of View (PoV)</a>.<br />
    <br />
    <strong>Customer Workshop</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The expectation post the delivery of the high-level PoV is to engage with the customer in a deeper dive workshop to
    work through details outlined in the PoV and translate that into an actionable roadmap. An appropriate Customer
    Workshop (e.g. Digital Transformation workshop) is selected based on the domain of the targeted business scenarios.
    This workshop provides clients with additional scenarios and details about transformative actions for their business
    processes. It also allows the engagement to go to the architectural level to design a solution architecture that will
    be friendly to client's ecosystem.
