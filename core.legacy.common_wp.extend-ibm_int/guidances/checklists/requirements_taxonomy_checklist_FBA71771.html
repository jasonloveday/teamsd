    The attached requirements taxonomy is designed to be used as an aid to the&nbsp;architect or business analyst&nbsp;in
    developing or confirming a set of requirements to be used in a solution design and development activity.&nbsp; Two use
    cases are envisioned for this taxonomy:<br />
    1. The development and analysis of a set of requirements by a Solution Designer / Chief Architect usage wherein the
    taxonomy is used as a checklist to allow the solution designer to consider aspects of the environment, constraints, and
    client needs that perhaps have not otherwise come up in discussion with the client. In this use case, the taxonomy used
    to:<br />
    &nbsp;- Guide client discussions<br />
    &nbsp;- Verify IBM has enough information to scope (define the boundaries of) the solution space.<br />
    &nbsp;- Verify IBM has sufficient insight to accurately design a solution that can be estimated and the risk assessed
    with a reasonable degree of confidence
</p>
<p>
    2. Technical Reviewer usage wherein the taxonomy is used to determine the completeness of the requirements set and aid
    in the assessment of the compliance of the design.&nbsp; In this use case, the taxonomy can be used to support either
    (or both) the Technical and Delivery Assessment (TDA) and the Integrated Technical Review (ITR).
</p>
<p>
    The Taxonomy represents one of three views into the requirements space, the taxonomic view.&nbsp; The three views
    should be understood in relationship to one another, so are briefly described here:
</p>
<p>
    I.&nbsp; The Hierarchical view:&nbsp; This view describes the relationship between the requirements at the top level of
    system, or system of systems, and its composite elements. &nbsp;It can be thought of as relating a system to segments,
    segments to subsystems, subsystems to configuration items, configuration items to components, components to modules,
    and modules to individual units. &nbsp;Some large systems may allow for recursive levels, while others may be comprised
    of but two levels of requirements.&nbsp; The hierarchical view only looks at the parent/child relationship of
    requirements, including its allocation to elements at the next level of decomposition. &nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    II.&nbsp; The Lifecycle view:&nbsp; This view follows a requirement across the lifecycle of a project, from derivation
    or elicitation, to decomposition, to assignment to design elements, assignment to a test level, to assignment to test
    procudures, and finally to documentation of ass/fail test results.
</p>
<p>
    III.&nbsp; The Taxonomic View: The taxonomic view represents a taxonomy of requirements types (or areas) that one
    should consider in any development effort. &nbsp;The requirements areas within this taxonomy can be found at nearly any
    hierarchical level of a large or complex system.&nbsp; This view was created as a simple mental checklist to ensure all
    requirements areas of the system and its components, and associated deployment considerations, have at least been
    considered and documented as warranted (or not). &nbsp;It expands beyond the basic functional and non-functional areas
    to include many others that IBM has found to be necessary but much less commonly addressed in the solution design
    phase.
</p>
<p>
    Please note that the taxonomy also contains summary desciptions of most of the requirements areas.&nbsp; The intent is
    to give the practitioner enough insight to determine applicability – and to do a search for additional information
    on-line.
</p>
<p>
    Disclaimer: The taxonomy is not complete, and does not map perfectly to all engagement types.&nbsp; The philosophy of
    this taxonomy is ‘something for everyone’, not ‘everything for everyone'.&nbsp; Several applications of the taxonomy
    were considered in development, including:<br />
    &nbsp;- Tailoring IBM products to achieve a specific purpose /provide a specific functionality<br />
    &nbsp;- Tailoring an IBM solution (e.g., CCRA) to a client specific needs<br />
    &nbsp;- Developing a new capability from scratch (think GBS Application Development)<br />
    &nbsp;- Developing a capability from packaged applications (PSI, SAP, Oracle)<br />
    &nbsp;- A Complex System Integration development activity<br />
    &nbsp;- A Transition and Transformation engagement<br />
    What is most common among those use cases is well represented herein, however, as a practitioner you will need to
    evaluate which parts of the taxonomy are most applicable to your engagements. You can exclude areas that are less
    applicable, but at your own risk.&nbsp; You should also identify which areas you may need to expend upon as well, along
    with what resource you may use to expand them."<br />
