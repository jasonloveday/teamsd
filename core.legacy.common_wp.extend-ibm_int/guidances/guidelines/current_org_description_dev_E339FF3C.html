    1. Identify information sources needed for in-scope areas of the organization and obtain access<br />

</p>
<p>
    <strong>Identify information sources needed for in-scope areas of the organization and obtain access</strong>
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    This development approach can cover all elements of the organization, but you should ensure that you select and focus
    only on those elements that are in scope for the engagement. If a Change Project Description Form (ODR Inc.) has been
    completed for this engagement, it should help to clarify scope.<br />
    A variety of materials can be used to understand the current organization, including:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <div>
            Organization reports, annual reports, mission statements, and policy documents
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Interviews with managers and executives
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Interviews with other employees
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Functional (Finance, HR, IT) information sources for job descriptions and descriptions of management systems
            and programs

    <strong>Understand the structural elements of the organization through interviews and research</strong>
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Get an understanding of the in-scope structural elements at the enterprise, team/function, and individual levels by
    using the tool "Checklist to Investigate the Structure of the Current Organization." It addresses:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <div>
            The structural design of the organization at the firm or enterprise level (e.g., key organization units,
            policies and operating principles, key extended-enterprise relationships)
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            The structure of the organizational units themselves (e.g., functional groups and cross-functional teams,
            missions for the units, formal relationships among units)
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            The design of individual jobs for both management and employees (e.g., job roles and accountabilities, team
            roles, process used for job design)
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">
    Two theoretical models are available, which can provide ways to characterize the organization's structure.

<strong>Understand the behavioral elements of the design through interviews and research</strong> 
<p dir="ltr">
    Get an understanding of the in-scope behavioral elements on the enterprise, team/unit, and individual levels by using
    the Checklist to Investigate Behaviors in the Current Organization. This is aimed at understanding:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <div>
            The dominant culture of the organizational unit(s) at which the design activity is aimed (e.g., statement of
            culture/values at the corporate level, stated vs. actual corporate culture),
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            The dominant behaviors of formal units and teams and informal groups, (e.g., informal networks, formal
            communication flows, learning and mentoring practices, conflict management, teaming behaviors)
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            How individuals are expected to and actually behave (e.g., dominant behaviors and attitudes vs. desired norm on
            task management, communication, role modeling, coaching)
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">
    Consider using a culture assessment questionnaire (licensed by Professor Daniel Denison and available through the IBM
    Organization Change Knowledge Network) as a method to characterize the organization in terms of values, culture, and
    attitudes. This is a 50-question survey that describes the current culture in five areas and highlights strengths and
    weaknesses in each. However, remember that the purpose of this work product is to describe the organization rather than
    evaluate it, and be aware that the Denison tool uses value-laden language. The assessment of the current organization
    is described as a separate work product.<br />
    To order the Denison Organizational Culture Survey, contact:<br />
    Jay Richards<br />

    Ann Arbor, MI 48103<br />

    Fax: (734) 327-7689<br />
    E-mail Jayrich@aol.com<br />
    You can order sample packages of the survey from AVIAT at 1-800-421-5323 or visit the website at www.denisonculture.com
    for downloadable files.<br />
    Consider using the Managerial Styles Questionnaire (MSQ) to describe management styles. This survey asks managers to
    assess themselves and surveys their employees to see how perceptions vary. It categorizes people into six managerial
    styles and has proven to be very effective in providing diagnoses and prescriptions for effective leadership. For this
    work product, its value lies in providing a good set of descriptive terms for management styles.<br />
    To order the Managerial Style Questionnaire (participant version as well as interpretive notes), contact
    Hay/McBer<br />

    They're sold in sets of 10, at $78.35 per set.<br />
    Further information about the above two tools is also available via the link below to the FOAD Toolkit - Phase 1.<br />
    Consider using the Organization Network Analysis (ONA) tool to help understand the patterns of communications and
    working relationships within an organization. It maps and measures an organization's information flows, work
    relationships, knowledge, decision, and innovation networks. For detailed information about the ONA, follow the link
    below to the Organization Change intellectual capital database.
