    This matrix is generally developed in parallel with <u><i>other work products</i></u>, which document a potential set
    of solutions and the data needed by the solution set. It ties a specific set of information groupings to a specific
    solution area.
</p>
<h4>
    Purpose
</h4>
<p>
    <font size="2">The main purpose of a Solution Areas/Subject Area Model Matrix is to:</font>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <font size="2">Convey, in tabular or graphical format, the scope of a desired application or capability by linking
        the application and its data dependency.</font>
    </li>
    <li>
        <font size="2">Demonstrate the commonality of need between solution areas for the same information.</font>
    </li>
    <li>
        <font size="2">Demonstrate the commonality of need between subject areas for the same functions.</font>
    </li>
    <li>
        <font size="2">Provide parameters and boundaries for subsequent data analysis and data design activities. These
        boundaries may also impact subsequent architectural decisions.</font>
    </li>
    <li>
        <font size="2">Provide high-level planning constructs with respect to the data / information needs for the
        capability, application or enterprise.</font>
    </li>
    <li>
        <font size="2">To enable and support a proper alignment between the key information requirements of the enterprise,
        capability or application with the goals and objectives of the same.</font>
    </li>
    <li>
        <font size="2">To enable consultants and senior management to explore the constraints on the business and
        opportunities for, and implications of change.</font>
    </li>
    <li>
        <font size="2">To provide a useful vehicle for communication of the information and to encourage client ownership,
        acknowledgement and acceptance of the information presented.</font>
    </li>
    <li>
        <font size="2">Develop a document around a set of information that represents the consensus built by customer
        stakeholders.</font>
    </li>
    <li>
        <font size="2">Provide input into a detailed release plan and project estimates for a subsequent development
        effort.</font>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <font size="2">The construct of a mapping between solution areas and subject areas is simply a mechanism for the
    consultant to visually and powerfully convey their understanding of the relationship between solution areas and subject
    areas.</font>
</p>
<h4>
    Contexts of Use
</h4>
<p>
    <font size="2">This technique assists the consultant in justifying the prioritization of solution development projects
    by highlighting areas of risk. For example, if the proposed solution area includes a subject area whose information
    does not exist or is known to be of poor quality, the consultant would be justified in recommending a lower priority
    for that solution area.</font>
</p>
<h5>
    Step 1: Perform initial information gathering and and analysis preparation
</h5>
<p>
    <font size="2">Verify that the client understands the purpose of the <b>Solution Areas/Subject Area Model Matrix</b> –
    what it represents; how it was developed; and its importance in guiding the subsequent development work.</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font size="2">Validate the scope of the matrix, especially as it relates to the identified stakeholder groups whose
    input will form the basis of the results. Determine the solution areas and subject areas under consideration</font>
</p>
<h5>
    Step 2: Assess extent of capability definition, solution area and subject area definition
</h5>
<p>
    <font size="2">Specifically, for each of the Solution Areas under consideration:</font>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <font size="2">Identify impacted organizations from a consumer, supplier, governance, and support
        perspective.</font>
    </li>
    <li>
        <font size="2">Identity level of granularity of the information is required.</font>
    </li>
    <li>
        <font size="2">Determine degree of fit with existing capabilities.</font>
    </li>
    <li>
        <font size="2">Determine the degree of overlap or dependencies between areas.</font>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <font size="2">For the Subject Areas under consideration:</font>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <font size="2">Identify the candidate sources for the information, both internal and external.</font>
    </li>
    <li>
        <font size="2">Identify the levels of abstraction available for each Subject Area, in detail and timing.</font>
    </li>
    <li>
        <font size="2">Identify known risks to information quality, especially correctness and completeness.</font>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <font size="2">You may choose to base these findings on existing documentation, interviews or facilitated workshops, or
    a combination of these techniques.</font>
</p>
<h5>
    Step 3: Conduct interviews with business and technical communities
</h5>
<p>
    <font size="2">Validate with client stakeholder groups and client executive management the solution areas, information
    requirements, and their level of involvement with the solution areas, and stated business and technical impacts for
    implementing or deferring a solution area.</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font size="2">Verify that the client also understands the <b>Solution Areas/Subject Area Model Matrix</b> is a
    ‘guiding’ document to be referred to and developed more fully in subsequent iterations of the requirement definition
    process. Its main purpose is to develop a general application or capability scope, pointing out areas of commonality
    between solution areas or subject areas.</font>
</p>
<h5>
    Step 4: Review, analyze and document findings
</h5>
<p>
    <font size="2">The matrix is typically developed as a tabular mapping of the subject area groupings to the solution
    areas. Known characteristics of the mapping are indicated.</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font size="2">For example, each cell of the table might indicate:</font>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <font size="2">Whether data is primarily Created, Read, Updated or Deleted. The use of this technique results in a
        matrix that is sometimes referred to as a CRUD matrix.</font>
    </li>
    <li>
        <font size="2">Whether data is available through existing capabilities, or is under development or obtainable from
        external sources.</font>
    </li>
    <li>
        <font size="2">What stakeholders groups use, own, govern, or support the data.</font>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <font size="2">A significant and essential by-product of the development of this matrix is the consensus built around
    the results. By inviting input from all stakeholders with an interest in the enablement of a defined capability, and by
    leading them all through a structured and impartial process for the rational mapping of subject areas to solution
    areas, the consultant achieves the ‘buy-in’ to the scope of the application or capability.</font>
</p>
<h4>
    Tools
</h4>
<p>
    <font size="2">This matrix can be developed with any number of office productivity tools, word processors,
    spreadsheets, graphical applications such as Freelance, or using desktop database software, such as MS Access. The
    choice of tool should consider the skill set of the developer, the scope and depth of the matrix being undertaken, the
    office productivity tools available to the receiving audience, and the output format of the engagement’s
    deliverables.</font>
</p>
<h4>
    Validation and Verification
</h4>
<p>
    <font size="2">Validate that client stakeholder groups and client executive management agree to the results documented
    in the matrix and can articulate the value of the process used to develop the results.</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font size="2">Verify that the client understands what a <b>Solution Area/Subject Area Model Matrix</b> is and the risk
    inherent in not developing this work product.</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font size="2">Verify that the client also understands the limits of a <b>Solution Area/Subject Area Model</b> and that
    it’s main purpose is to develop a general application or capability scope, pointing out areas of commonality between
    solution areas or subject areas.</font>
</p>
<h4>
    Advice and Guidance
</h4>
<p>
    <font size="2"><font size="2">This technique demonstrates an understanding of the linkage of a customer’s high-level
    information requirements and the enterprise, capability or application needs being enabled. The <b>Solution
    Areas/Subject Area Model Matrix</b> requires a subsequent analysis and design effort to justify its benefits. If the
    client appears unable, unwilling or unlikely to proceed beyond a capability definition engagement, this technique may
    be postponed.</font></font>
</p>
<p>
    <font size="2"><font size="2">Should this matrix not be prepared, then any combination of the following may
    occur:</font></font>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <font size="2"><font size="2">Changes in data or information requirements related to changes in scope of a solution
        area are not easily demonstrated or documented.</font></font>
    </li>
    <li>
        <font size="2"><font size="2">Likewise, changes in a set of solution areas that result in additional or enhanced
        subject areas are not easily demonstrated or documented.</font></font>
    </li>
    <li>
        <font size="2"><font size="2">Commonality of need (data as well as function) is not easily identified. An
        assessment of information sharing requirements, across business units or functional areas, is not
        possible.</font></font>
    </li>
    <li>
        <font size="2"><font size="2">The project team begins an Analysis and Design effort in which the scope and vision
        of the project have not been fully established. This situation jeopardizes both requirements definition as well as
        project estimation activities.</font></font>
    </li>
    <li>
        <font size="2"><font size="2">Under certain project circumstances, this matrix may not be needed, or it may need to
        be prepared in an abbreviated form. These circumstances are presented below, where:</font></font>
    </li>
    <li>
        <font size="2"><font size="2">The client organization or another vendor or another IBM consulting organization has
        formulated this information and can provide it in documented form.</font></font>
    </li>
    <li>
        <font size="2"><font size="2">Client management has mandated that this specific technique be omitted from the scope
        of an engagement. However, the relative risk of release plans and project estimates created without benefit of the
        <b>Solution Areas/Subject Area Model Matrix</b> will increase.</font></font>
    </li>
    <li>
        <font size="2"><font size="2">Verify that the client understands the key skills required developing this matrix in
        the event that they wish to assume ownership of its maintenance in the future.</font></font>
    </li>
    <li>
        <font size="2"><font size="2">The development of the <b>Solution Areas/Subject Area Model Matrix</b> depends
        greatly on two key skills: 1.) Industry/functional subject matter expertise; and, 2.) Facilitation
        experience.</font></font>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <font size="2"><font size="2">For example a customer whose:</font></font>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <font size="2"><font size="2">primary product is women’s apparel</font></font>
    </li>
    <li>
        <font size="2"><font size="2">main distribution method is through catalog sales</font></font>
    </li>
    <li>
        <font size="2"><font size="2">business intelligence interest is centered around controlling costs</font></font>
    </li>
    <li>
        <font size="2"><font size="2">increasing the average purchase quantity and total dollar amount per
        order</font></font>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <font size="2"><font size="2">The customer would need an industry subject matter expert on the project team who is
    familiar with the main drivers of cost control and customer buying habits in this environment. Facilitation skills are
    important because it is a primary technique used to engage the customer in articulating their information needs and the
    decisions the desired information needs to support.</font></font>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <font size="2"><font size="2">A third, but less important skill dependency for the development of this matrix is
        data analysis or data modeling skill.</font></font>
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    Estimating Considerations
</h4>
<p>
    <font size="2"><font size="2">A major estimating factor is the degree of definition of the input work products. The
    more complete and more consensus developed regarding their completeness, the less time it will take to complete the
    matrix.</font></font>
</p>
<p>
    <font size="2"><font size="2">If it is determined that more definition needs to be developed for the input work
    products, a second estimating factor is determining the method to be used in soliciting additional requirements and
    confirming the results. The major methods of information gathering used are:</font></font>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <font size="2"><font size="2">Documentation review</font></font>
    </li>
    <li>
        <font size="2"><font size="2">Interviews (individual or group)</font></font>
    </li>
    <li>
        <font size="2"><font size="2">Facilitated group sessions</font></font>
    </li>
    <li>
        <font size="2"><font size="2">A combination of interviews and facilitated sessions</font></font>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <font size="2"><font size="2">The selection of which method to use is dependent on factors such as availability of
    documentation, the number of individuals to be interviewed, the culture of information sharing in the organization, the
    time limitations of the project, and the relative difficulty of coordinating calendars for group
    sessions.</font></font>
</p>
<p>
    <font size="2"><font size="2">Once the method of information gathering has been determined, the important estimating
    factor is the number and length of information gathering and verification sessions to conduct. In addition, adequate
    time to prepare and summarize each session should also be set aside.</font></font>
</p>
<p>
    <font size="2"><font size="2">In general, the larger the number of stakeholders to interview and the greater the
    outside demands on their time, the greater the impact this entire work effort will have on project
    duration.</font></font>
