    Welcome to the Team Solution Design Delivery Process
</h3>
<p>
    The audience for Team Solution Design (TeamSD) is IT Architects and Specialists engaged in pre-sales solution design
    roles. Team Solution Design is an architecture method that also provides guidance in planning and implementation
    activities for the pre-sales solution designer.
</p>
<p>
    This is <strong>version 2.3 of Team Solution Design</strong> and the third iteration for the Modernization of the
    method to reflect IBM’s transformation and the changes in the markets we serve. The continuing evolution of TeamSD is
    focused on relevancy and provides prescriptive guidance in the use of the method while leveraging leading practices
    such as IBM Design Thinking and Agile, assets and accelerators. We need to engage with our clients effectively to
    understand their pain points and challenges so that we can design innovative solutions rapidly, leveraging IBM's
    strategic platforms / solutions and open standards where appropriate, to deliver meaningful outcomes.
</p>
<p>
    TeamSD along with the companion guidance module for TeamSD in Solution Seeker are referred to as TeamSD Next.
</p>
<p>
    The TeamSD Next Guidance module in <a href="https://w3-connections.ibm.com/communities/service/html/communitystart?communityUuid=8cdf560f-9b7f-4f5e-a2f1-a8b3df725c19" target="_blank">Solution Seeker</a> provides the ability to capture notes and early sketches on a Solution Design at
    an Activity and Task level. This tool provides a checklist interface to make the Activities and Tasks of TeamSD more
    readily referenced in daily practice. There are links to the full TeamSD method content provided, but the emphasis is
    on effective practice and early elaboration of work products during Technical Sales. Collaboration features and export
    of all Opportunity notes and attached images are more recent features added to the TeamSD Next tool.
</p>
<p>
    This third iteration of the TeamSD Next method includes:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Changes to how Activities are documented:</strong> Adoption of Agile Method Framework’s approach in
        documenting the content - Each activity has a primary purpose to accomplish and this is manifested in a table of
        Objectives, Guidance Materials and Tips/Considerations.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Addition of guidance:</strong>
    </li>
    <li style="LIST-STYLE-TYPE: none">
        <ul>
            <li>
                Discovery MindMap that contains the type of information to be gathered or understood to better understand
                client needs.
            </li>
            <li>
                Developing a Customer Point of View to provide a compelling business-oriented recommendation for customers
                regarding a specific business problem. The PoV is expected to be a discussion starter and a door opener to
                pursue further discovery and validation activities with customers.
            </li>
            <li>
                Conducting a Customer Workshop in collaboration with clients to address the impact of business and
                technology shifts to their business and showing how we can help.
            </li>
            <li>
                Solution Design Recipes which are scenario-specific prescriptive guidance with outcomes, elements or
                “ingredients” and steps on what to do.
            </li>
            <li>
                Effective use of IBM Design Thinking in support of Solution Design via an updated guideline and new
                companion whitepaper.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Updates to Guidelines and Whitepapers</strong> which will be made available in the <a href="http://ibm.biz/ICSDcommunity" target="_blank">Integrated Cognitive Solution Design community</a> in the <a href="https://apps.na.collabserv.com/wikis/home?lang=en-us#!/wiki/W167e00dd00f8_4b31_b626_4401171a1197/page/Method Supplemental Guidance" target="_blank">Method Supplemental Guidance Wiki</a>. This reorganization allows for more frequent updates to
        ensure currency of the guidelines and whitepapers.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The <a href="http://ibm.biz/TeamSDNextWiki" target="_blank">Team Solution Design community</a> is located within the
    Integrated Cognitive Solution community and is your starting point for information about Team Solution Design including
    "What's New?", links to education, where to get assistance on Solution Design questions, and much more.
</p>
<p>
    Team Solution Design benefits from the input of the TeamSD board of advisors and input from the over 100 active TeamSD
    instructors worldwide who continue to make TeamSD a vital method for IBM Technical Leaders across all IBM business
    units.
</p>
<p>
    Team Solution Design was created to align with Client Value Method (CVM) for IBM Sales and the direction of IBM’s
    executive leadership (Integration and Value Team: Client Value Initiative) for a unified approach to Solution Design
    for all IBM business units, with a method defined in the Unified Method Framework. Team Solution Design is that
    Solution Design process.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><u>Team Solution Design is guided by the following Core Principles:</u></strong>
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        A single method, across all IBM brands, for pre-sale Solution Design, aligned with the IBM sales method (CVM).
    </li>
    <li>
        An approach that is part of UMF to provide linkage to the full Solution Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
    </li>
    <li>
        Demonstrate to clients IBM’s technical leadership in Solution Design and IT Architecture
    </li>
    <li>
        Support the timely Preparation for Client discussions that is required in pre-sales
    </li>
    <li>
        Enable Agility in the development of Value Propositions for Clients
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    The philosophy of Team Solution Design is to provide a pre-integrated, flexible process that can scale (up or down)
    depending on the size and complexity of the opportunity and the required solution design. TeamSD strongly encourages
    the use of Assets and the use of Iteration to elaborate the work products to the appropriate level to support both the
    commitments to clients in our proposals and the transition to successful delivery of client outcomes.
</p>
<p>
    It is important to remember that TeamSD provides a structure for discovery, invention, innovation, insight, analysis
    and synthesis in support of our client objectives. It is not just about work products! The work products are simply a
    way to make sure that insights, innovations and conclusions have been captured, for communication as well as for
    knowledge transfer.
