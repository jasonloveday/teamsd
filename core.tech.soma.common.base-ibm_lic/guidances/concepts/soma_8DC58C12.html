<td class="sectionTableSingleCell">IBM Service-oriented Modeling and Architecture<sup>TM</sup> (SOMA), is IBM’s end-to-end method for designing and developing
applications and solutions based on service-oriented principles; allowing a hybrid of solution and implementation types to
provide an optimal combination for a given project. It is the next step in the evolution of software engineering using the
principles of service-orientation, regardless of final implementation technologies. 
<p>
    Thus, SOMA provides prescriptive guidance in the development of various kinds of solutions, whether the target
    architecture is SOA or not. It allows and integrates various popular styles of solution development including custom
    application development, legacy integration and transformation, packaged application integration, composite business
    services (construction and consumption).
</p>
<p>
    Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) has become increasingly pervasive in its use in developing solutions for our
    clients. SOA has grown to become increasingly mainstream in software engineering within the industry. The industry has
    matured and moved to an increased adoption of SOA and service-based aspects even in the context of traditional
    projects. The principles of object-orientaion of program to interfaces rather than implementations has matured and
    risen in generality to develop yet another paradigm shift of design using interfaces and how to create composite
    structures using these interfaces, called services. Services have effectively become the means of communication and a
    common language between business and IT. As such, a service portfolio is not only an enterprise asset, but also
    embodies the requirements of a business in terms of a set of interdependent business capabilities that can be composed
    and combined in unanticipated ways to support changing business needs. This gives the business and its IT support, the
    necessary agility to move at or beyond the speed of the market.<br />
    Thus, the percentage of projects using SOA grows as an organization matures (see Service Integration Maturity Mdoel
    (SIMM)) sand recognizes industry trends and alleviates internal pain points. SOA principles are increasingly used on
    non-SOA-specific projects as a set of software engineering best practices as a set of business capabilities that
    represent the design as well, separated from the implementation technologies.
</p>
<p>
    Today’s client solutions are hybrid in nature and are composed of multiple solution types such as package custom
    development, application integration, legacy integration and transformation, composite business services. Traditional
    projects express the need for the same decoupling of functionality from alternative, hybrid implementation options as
    provided by SOA capabilities . Client requirements and increased competition require IBM to continually evolve to adopt
    a base of more effective software engineering methods, techniques and principles. There is, thus, a need for current
    software development methods to incorporate the service abstraction and service orientation as a base (similar to
    objects, components over the years). That is what IBM has done with SOMA.<br />
</p>
<p>
    SOMA is aimed at technologically enabling a desired future set of business processes that the business would like to
    see as their day to day means of operations. SOMA does this through the identification, specification and realization
    of the five fundamental aspects of SOA, namely: business-aligned services, components, flows, information, rules and
    policies that form the foundation of an SOA and ultimately implementing and deploying these five constructs.<br />
</p>
<p>
    SOMA creates continuity and traceability between business intent and IT implementation by extending business
    characteristics (e.g. goals and key performance indicators) into the IT domains of analysis and architectural
    decisions. The analysis and modeling performed during SOMA remains mostly technology and product agnostic, but
    establishes a context and basis for making technology and product specific decisions in later phases of the lifecycle.
    It does so by providing guidance in the modeling (analysis and design) based on the service-oriented paradigm.<br />
    The SOMA Method is engineered to deliver and define hybrid solutions can be applied to various engagement types – SOA
    or non-SOA projects. The Service paradigm and its design guidance using SOMA allow us to model the common denominator
    of functionality and specify required non-functional requirements, then proceeding to map them to multiple relevant,
    underlying technologies and development styles. Service-orientation thus becomes a way to structure business
    functionality and the enterprise application portfolio.<br />
    At the heart of the method is the Service Model; a key artifact in SOMA , serving as the underlying basis for
    integrating multiple solution types; SOA or not. It captures the business capabilities needed by an enterprise and
    designs specifications without strict commitment to one implementation style.<br />
    <br />
    SOMA leverages IBM SOA Reference Architecture:Solution View (aka IBM SOA Solution Stack) as a blueprint to be
    instantiated and to facilitate the definition of the architecture for various levels of scope: the ecosystem, for an
    enterprise or for a specific solution. The IBM SOA Reference Architecture:Solution View supports different kind of
    architectural styles including the SOA, object-oriented, component based architecture, event-driven, message-driven
    styles. The maturity of our clients will indicate the combination of required architecture styles.<br />
