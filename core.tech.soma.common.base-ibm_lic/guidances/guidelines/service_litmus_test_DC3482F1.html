<td class="sectionTableSingleCell">The service litmus test must be applied in different phases within the software development lifecycle because the
understanding of the business after the priorities of the services and the need for the services within different scopes
tends to change.<br />
<p>
    Ensure that you do a weighted average of the different service litmus tests. For example for each service, or service
    operation as a row you should have a column for each service litmus test and a column right next to it for the weights
    or priority that you ascribe to that particular test each role would then have awaited some of the tests and the final
    result would be a weighted average for each service or service operation to decide to expose within a particular scope.
</p>
<p>
    Once candidate services have been selected and documented in the (categorized) Service Portfolio near the end of
    service identification, we then need to determine which ones should be exposed as services. Although, in theory, any
    candidate service could be exposed by exporting its interface as a service description, not every candidate service
    should be. It may not be economically and practically (non-functional requirements may be compromised) feasible to do
    so. In particular, the naïve decision to expose "all methods from all classes" will result in an overwhelming and often
    unmanageable number of services leading to the "Service Proliferation Syndrome". This creates huge performance and
    service management problems, not to mention the fact that we may be giving away the company’s intellectual capital.
    Moreover, we must remember that there is a cost associated with every service we choose to expose: the funding,
    governance and the underlying infrastructure (its security, performance, management) of the service and the components
    that will implement them must be taken into account.
</p>
<p>
    Therefore, some criteria are needed to help decide whether to expose a service and most importantly, whether to fund
    the creation of the service component that will provide the functionality of the service as well as the maintenance,
    monitoring, security, performance and other service level agreements of the service. This decision making process is
    referred to as the "Service Exposure Decisions".
</p>
<p>
    Initial project experiences indicate a set of criteria in the form of the Service Litmus Test can and should be used to
    filter the collections of candidate services. This metaphor is used to denote a set of tests, that when applied, will
    determine if a given service should be eligible for exposure using a service description. These tests are employed
    together and help answer questions such as – "From the list of candidate services, which ones should be exposed? And
    thus, which ones should we fund? Which ones have business value?"
</p>
<p>
    On the one extreme, every business use case might be considered to be a candidate service. On the other, only a few
    services are selected for exposure. Applying the SLT usually gives something in the middle: a manageable set of
    services that the business wants to expose and that can later be used within compositions.
</p>
<p>
    Table 4-1 contains the descriptions of the key categories of the Service Litmus Test that collectively form the
    "gating" criteria for service exposure.
</p>
<p>
    Candidate services that pass all four parts of the Service Litmus Test should then be exposed as services in the SOA.
    There may be candidate services that did not pass the SLT but which are still implemented as services. SLT is an aid to
    determine which services to expose; if a business chooses to expose candidate services that did not pass the SLT, the
    implication is that benefits associated with a SOA will not be realized.
</p>
<p>
    Candidate services that do not meet the SLT will have to be implemented in some fashion as they are required to fulfill
    business needs. They may be implemented as methods on service components and will not require the generation of WSDL or
    other forms of service definitions; or they may be used as non-exposable entities.
</p>
<p>
    A negative response to any of the following questions results in a candidate service failing the Service Litmus Test.

                    The first test of a service is about its Business Alignment. If the service is not traceable back to a
                    business task or goal, it may not yield benefits required for SOA implementation.

                    The following questions, if all are answered positively, mean the service is aligned with the business.

                <p>
                    SLT1-1. Does the service provide a required business functionality that supports business processes and
                    goals? Is there a business goal that this service directly (versus "inherits" from its children)
                    supports?

                <p>
                    SLT1-2. Is the business willing to fund the service through its lifecycle: provisioning, management,
                    governance and maintenance?
                </p>
                <p>
                    SLT1-3. Is the business willing to share the service internally or externally with clients or business
                    partners? For example, implications may be additional costs, business secrets, security, etc.

                    Composability is defined as an attribute that enables the service to participate in a service
                    composition.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Applications can be created using both types of composition – hardwired and loosely wired.

                <p>
                    SLT2-1. Does the service meet the required QoS attributes as defined in the composition’s NFRs?
                </p>
                <p>
                    SLT2-2. Is the service stateless?
                </p>
                <p>
                    SLT2-3. Is the service self-contained? Can the service be deployed independently to meet a business
                    goal although it may cooperate with other services at run-time to perform business processes? There are
                    no implicit dependencies of the service on other embedded functionality. All dependent services are
                    either replaceable or self-contained.
                </p>
                <p>
                    SLT2-4. Is the service’s implementation technology neutral?<br />
                    Technology neutral means that the service does not impose support of non-standard (and unknown to the
                    consumer) protocols or devices, for example, the constituent component requires intervention through a
                    non-standard application interface.<br />
                    This test applies only when the service is deployed in the consumer’s environment. For example: A
                    business provides an image retrieval service to its customers. It can provide this capability to its
                    subscribed customers via a web service. Alternatively, the business can hand over to its customer the
                    image retrieval capability exposed as a web service, and a collection of images. Here, the customer
                    will be burdened by the implementation of the technology search.

    Table 4-1: Service Litmus Test
</p>
<p>
    Note: There are two types of service compositions:
</p>
<p>
    1. Hardwired composite services. They are characterized by low flexibility, owing to pre-defined flow and control of
    services where the flow and control is not externalized. These types of services have attractive Qualities of Service
    attributes such as performance.
</p>
<p>
    2. Loosely wired composite services. They are characterized by high flexibility where composing services into business
    processes is accomplished by externalizing flow and control. The flow description of the composition is externalized.
    This type of composition exploits modeling tools, dynamic variability through rules, and static variability through
    modeling. Composition using BPEL is an example.
</p>
<p>
    It is important to recognize that a variety of factors can affect service exposure decisions, such as the level of
    capability and maturity that an organization has reached with respect to SOA. The SLT is the key criteria recommended
    for most situations. Nevertheless, an organization that is early in the adoption cycle may want to expose a few
    services as a way to experiment with a technology like Web Services. The business and technology drivers (e.g.,
    maturity, requirements for exposure of specific services) can override the litmus test.
</p>
<p>
    We recommend creating a spreadsheet with priorities weighted and a weighted product be used to measure the SLT results
    ofr each operation on a service.
