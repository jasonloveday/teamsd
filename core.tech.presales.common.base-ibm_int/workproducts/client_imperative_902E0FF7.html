<th class="sectionTableHeading" scope="row">Main Description</th><td class="sectionTableCell"><p>
    The Client Imperative is typically used in a pre-sale context to formally describe what the client is trying to achieve
    and why. The following is an example of a client imperative definition.
</p>
<blockquote style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px" dir="ltr">
    <p>
        <em>"Enable a &lt;xyz bank's&gt; Multichannel Delivery Strategy with an Optimal Architecture and Technology
        Platform"</em>
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
    As described in the brief outline, a complete imperative definition contains information that answers key questions
    such as:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>What is the client trying to achieve?</strong> <strong>(the imperative)<br />
            </strong>The client imperative definition is a succinct and actionable statement that expresses an answer to
            this question. The imperative is also accompanied by further explanation or description. The initial client
            imperative is typically expressed by the client sponsor. Completing all aspects of the imperative is
            accomplished by analysis of client information gathered in interviews and meetings. These statements may
            include statements of fact, opinion, problems, issues, need and intent. As the imperative is inferred from this
            analysis, its correctness and viability should tested by answering the following additional questions.<br />
            <br />
            If this opportunity originated with the client's interest in one of the IBM Blueprint's Industry Imperatives,
            the Client Imperative represents a specialization of the Industry Imperative, tailored to suit a specific
            client's needs. In such cases, information associated with the Industry Imperative may be helpful in
            documenting the client imperative.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>Why is the client trying to achieve this?</strong> <strong>(motivation, the compelling reason to
            act)</strong><br />
            Compelling reasons to act may include implementing a disruptive competitive strategy, external environmental
            factors or concerns about performance and efficiency. Essentially, this question is about establishing the
            client's motivation which serves as evidence that the statement "The client is trying to achieve (imperative
            definition)" is true. Given an initial imperative that has been expressed directly by the client, proposed by
            IBM&nbsp;or inferred from your analysis, the evidence from interviews, meetings and other statements by the
            client should support your conclusion about what the client is trying to achieve. For example, an interviewee
            may directly contradict the initial imperative definition by saying "that might be interesting, but what we
            really need to do is the following". Evidence of this sort may indicate that the initial imperative definition
            needs revision or specialization, or that more than one imperative should be considered. If a client statement
            expresses a particular need or problem, evaluate whether the imperative under consideration satisfies that need
            or addresses the stated problem. Would achieving the stated imperative yield the desired business outcomes and
            benefits as stated in client interviews? If the evidence does not support the proposed imperative, it may be
            necessary to revise the imperative (with the client sponsor's approval).<br />
            <br />
            In cases where the client imperative is related to an IBM Blueprint Industry Imperative, consult the Industry
            Imperative documentation for information on common industry motivation for addressing this imperative.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>How can the client achieve this? (the solution strategy)</strong><br />
            If the defined imperative is realistic, it should be possible to express the response to the imperative as a
            high level solution strategy. This strategy would describe an approach, including tactics, in high level
            business and architectural terms, possibly based on a successful approach used elsewhere. Evidence of a viable
            solution strategy should further support the belief that the client imperative has been well defined and is
            achievable. Strategy aspects (tactics) may range from establishing new business capabilities to specific
            capability enablers.<br />
            <br />
            In cases where the client imperative is related to an IBM Blueprint Industry Imperative, consult the Industry
            Imperative documentation for possible stages of transformation and available industry solutions that may inform
            the solution strategy.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>What are the likely inhibitors?<br />
            </strong>This is a final test of the expected viability of the proposed imperative. As desirable as achieving
            the results may be, inhibitors such as high cost, limited skills and resources, cultural and societal issues,
            etc. may force a reevaluation of the imperative.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>What are the expected business outcomes and benefits?<br />
            </strong>Although normally intended for solution proposal, guidance on developing a value proposition may
            provide insight for this section. If the client imperative represents a specialization of an IBM Blueprint
            Industry Imperative, consult information associated with the Industry Imperative for candidate business
            outcomes.
        </p>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    A correctly defined imperative will ensure that the imperative is supported by strong evidence of the client's need and
    intent and that there is a proposed solution strategy that illustrates a viable approach to addressing this imperative.

<td class="sectionTableSingleCell"><p>
    The following comments describe a few of the many situations that may arise when attempting to define a client
    imperative.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The <strong>“given”</strong> imperative: In some cases, the client may carefully consider all of the issues and
        express a well formed imperative in initial discussions. This becomes the candidate imperative that is used during
        interviews and analysis. Although the imperative may stand up to further analysis, it needs to be tested with the
        other questions above. In some cases it may need revision (with the client’s agreement) if, for example, it is too
        general (not actionable) as discovered when developing a solution strategy.<br />
        <br />
        If the "given" imperative is based on&nbsp;one of the IBM Blueprint's Industry Imperatives, it will likely have to
        be&nbsp;specialized&nbsp;to suit a specific the client's specific needs.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
        &nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        The <strong>“implied”</strong> imperative: The client sponsor may express only issues and problems where the
        implied imperative is simply “fix this”. Although this information is a helpful starting point, it will be
        necessary to infer the imperative from the results of interviews, analysis and potential solution strategies.<br />
        &nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        The <strong>“too narrow”</strong> imperative: If the imperative is expressed by the client initially, it may be
        very specific, narrow or low level. Accepting this definition may unduly constrain the proposed solution strategy
        and omit other desirable elements of the strategy. This type of imperative may be improved by asking questions that
        lead to a more general definition of the imperative, which addresses not only the original imperative, but other
        vital issues that should have been included.<br />
        &nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        The <strong>“too broad”</strong> imperative: Some imperatives that relate to general business transformation may be
        too broad or abstract to be actionable. In such a case, it may be helpful to decompose the imperative into several
        more specific, actionable imperatives that are supported by analysis of user statements and together satisfy the
        intent of the original imperative. The solution strategy of a broad, complex imperative is likely to have multiple
        significant aspects (referred to as tactics). These aspects (tactics) may indicate that the imperative could be
        refactored into individual imperatives. Ultimately the granularity of the imperative is an arbitrary choice,
        influenced by the need for clarity and actionable individual imperatives.<br />
    </li>
</ul>
