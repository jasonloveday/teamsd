    The following are some of the general&nbsp;requirements from the ESS e-business Reference Architecture that are very
    useful as examples to keep in mind not only while architecting a solution, but also when gathering requirements and
    setting customer expectations. These examples&nbsp;are based on experience gained from deploying many e-business
    solutions.They&nbsp;are examples&nbsp;that communicate various aspects of an e-business solution. However, note that
    the specific needs of any given application are likely to be different and therefore must be analyzed and researched to
    a sufficient degree. Also, these requirements would likely be split into several separate and more specific
    requirements with more specific names.

                    authentication, authorization, and Non-Repudiation are generally considered less secure than solutions
                    where the security is implemented through the infrastructure.

                    A hit is a request for a file (not a web page) to a web server. A file could contain text, image,
                    audio, video, binaries, etc. A web page is composed of one or more files. On average, a web page
                    contains ten files. In other words, a hit on a page could result into requests for ten files.&nbsp; The
                    variance on this value is quite large. One of the world’s busiest web sites sees more than twelve
                    million hits during its peak hour.&nbsp; In the case of Internet Applications the number of users could
                    depend on how the site is advertised. In the case of an Intranet Application the number of users could
                    depend on what are the alternative methods available to accomplish the same task and how the employees
                    are motivated to use the Intranet Application.&nbsp;&nbsp;

                    Rendering dynamic content to a browser requires significantly more processing power than does serving
                    up static content from a file system. The extent of additional resources required varies with the
                    method employed. A simple approach to estimating resource consumption for dynamic pages: If a static
                    page takes "X" resources, then the dynamic processing, database look-up, page formatting, etc. will
                    require, "N" times "X".&nbsp; This assumes the workload resource consumption profile (for example the
                    ratio of disk I/O to LAN bandwidth) for the two types of processing are identical with just a
                    multiplication factor required.&nbsp; For example, if a total of one static page and one dynamic page
                    are served per hour, and the dynamic page consumes 100 times, the resources of the static page then one
                    can think of serving those two pages as the equivalent of serving a total of 101 static pages.
