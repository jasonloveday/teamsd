                1. This will restrict more complex knowledge of integrating with CICS systems to a small team instead of
                all developers. 2. If changes occur in the backend systems, application logic is protected, with changes
                limited to data access methods of the business object layer. 3. This supports the architectural principle
                on Complexity hiding.

                Because of the degree of application integration needed, a decision must be made on enterprise connectivity
                to avoid inconsistent and unmanageable connectivity.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                <b>Alternatives</b>
            </td>
            <td>
                <u>1. Point-to-Point Connectivity</u> This alternative connects the application server connect directly and
                individually to each necessary enterprise system, using the protocol best suited for that system.&nbsp; For
                example, connectivity to the mainframe could use Common Programming Interface for Communications
                (CPI-C).&nbsp; Alternatively, messages could be exchanged individually with each system using a messaging
                product such as Message Queuing Series (MQSeries) or Electronic Data Interchange (EDI).&nbsp; A very basic
                option would be to exchange data via File Transfer Protocol (FTP).<br />
                <br />
                <u>2. Integration Hub</u> This alternative centralizes all enterprise communications at a common
                intermediary called an Integration Hub.&nbsp; Business-level messages are given to the hub for
                delivery.&nbsp; The hub routes the message to the correct enterprise system, translating the message if
                necessary into a format acceptable by the enterprise system and communicating with the enterprise system in
                an appropriate protocol.&nbsp; This hub can be used to support synchronous and asynchronous
                integration.<br />
                <br />
                <u>3. Business Workflow</u> This alternative adds onto the Integration Hub by adding business process
                functions to its capabilities.&nbsp; A message would trigger a set of further messages to different
                destinations based on a pre-defined workflow for that business process.

            </td>
            <td>
                The e-business Reference Architecture will use the Integration Hub to enable enterprise connectivity. This
                alternative provides a consistent message based option for integration with disparate backend
                systems.&nbsp; Further this option can be easily extended as needed to support Business Workflow as needed.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                <b>Justification</b>
            </td>
            <td>
                Because of the number of different systems that must be accessed by any e-business application, it would
                seem prudent to have the application server communicate using one method (messages) to one system (the
                Integration Hub).&nbsp; This also provides the flexibility of relocating data and functions to different
                enterprise systems with no change to systems that access that data.&nbsp; Furthermore, the Integration Hub
                will simplify communications among all legacy systems and databases, allowing other projects within the
                enterprise to leverage this investment.<br />
                <br />
                The translation capabilities of the Integration Hub are also a big advantage in the business-to-business
                world.&nbsp; It is expected that this hub would be accessible to authorized trading partners, each of whom
                may adopt a different message “standard” for their business-to-business&nbsp; (B2B) communications.&nbsp;
                The Integration Hub would be able to translate these different message formats into a consistent format for
                communication with the organization’s enterprise system.<br />
                <br />
                Another advantage of this option is its ability to support different collaboration models such as
                blackboard, point-to-point or Publish/Subscribe.<br />
                <br />
                Although the business workflow option is intriguing and seems to offer benefits, at this time there does
                not seem to be a sufficient gain in this process for the cost incurred.&nbsp; However, as the
                organization’s business and technical processes evolve, this option could be added onto the Integration
                Hub’s functionality.

                All enterprise applications will need to be enabled for working with the Integration hub.&nbsp; A set of
                business messages will need to be defined, as well as translation rules for other systems.

    Architecture principles can be very helpful in&nbsp;considering&nbsp;architectural decisions. The client should be able
    to tell you if there are important IT or design principles that you should consider in developing a solution in the
    pre-sale environment. You may choose to develop other principles in collaboration with the client. The following table
    gives an example of how to record such principles.<br />

                In this context, client developers are responsible for developing applets, servlets and HTML. Legacy data
                will be accessed from within servlets. The servlet developer must be presented a common interface that is
                independent of the number and type of backend legacy systems.

                Over time, the legacy systems will change and new ones may be added. It is desirable to insulate client
                programs from these changes. It is also desirable to simplify the client programming model by having a
                single interface for programmers to learn that does not change as backend systems change.
