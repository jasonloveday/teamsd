    Defining the <strong>Client Imperative</strong> is accomplished through analysis of client statements and ultimately
    focuses on a single statement of the imperative and accompanying explanation that expresses what the client is trying
    to achieve. Determining the imperative is not always straightforward. To ensure that you arrive at the correct
    imperative(s) and therefore an appropriate opportunity description, it is necessary to answer several key questions.
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <strong>What is the client trying to achieve? (the imperative)<br />
        </strong>The client imperative is a succinct and actionable statement that expresses an answer to this question.
        The imperative is also accompanied by further explanation or description. Defining the imperative is accomplished
        by analysis of client information gathered in interviews and meetings. These statements may include statements of
        fact, opinion, problems, issues, need and intent. As the imperative is inferred from this analysis, its correctness
        and viability should tested by answering the following additional questions.<br />
        <br />
        If the "given" imperative is based on&nbsp;one of the IBM Blueprint's Industry Imperatives, it will likely have to
        be&nbsp;specialized&nbsp;to suit a specific the client's specific needs.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        &nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Why is the client trying to achieve this? (the compelling reason to act)<br />
        </strong>Essentially, this question is about establishing the client's motivation which serves as evidence that the
        statement “The client is trying to achieve [imperative statement]” is true. Given an initial&nbsp;imperative that
        has been expressed directly by the client or inferred from your analysis, the evidence from interviews, meetings
        and other statements by the client should support your conclusion about what the client is trying to achieve. For
        example, an interviewee may directly contradict the candidate imperative statement by saying “that might be
        interesting, but what we really need to do is the following”. Evidence of this sort may indicate that the candidate
        imperative needs revision or that more than one imperative should be considered. If a client statement expresses a
        particular need or problem, evaluate whether the imperative under consideration satisfies that need or addresses
        the stated problem. Would achieving the stated imperative yield the desired business benefits as stated in client
        interviews? If the evidence does not support the proposed imperative, it may be necessary to revise the
        imperative.<br />
        <br />
        In cases where the client imperative is related to an IBM Blueprint Industry Imperative, consult the Industry
        Imperative documentation for information on common industry motivation for addressing this imperative.&nbsp;<br />
        &nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>How can the client achieve this? (the solution strategy)<br />
        </strong>If the defined imperative is realistic, it should be possible to express the response to the imperative as
        a high level solution strategy. This strategy would describe an approach, including tactics, in high level business
        and architectural terms, possibly based on a successful approach used elsewhere. Evidence of a viable solution
        strategy should further support the belief that the client imperative has been well defined and is
        achievable.<br />
        <br />
        In cases where the client imperative is related to an IBM Blueprint Industry Imperative, consult the Industry
        Imperative documentation for possible stages of transformation and available industry solutions&nbsp;that may
        inform the solution strategy.&nbsp;<br />
        &nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>What are the likely inhibitors?<br />
        </strong>This is a final test of the expected viability of the proposed imperative. As desirable as achieving the
        results may be, inhibitors such as high cost, limited skills and resources, etc. may force a reevaluation of the
        imperative.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>What are the expected business outcomes and benefits?<br />
            </strong>Although normally intended for solution proposal, guidance on developing a value proposition may
            provide insight for this section. If the client imperative represents a specialization of an IBM Blueprint
            Industry Imperative, consult information associated with the Industry Imperative for candidate business
            outcomes.
        </p>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    There following comments describe a few of the many situations that may arise when attempting to define a
    client&nbsp;imperative.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The <strong>“given”</strong> imperative: In some cases, the client may carefully consider all of the issues and
        express a well formed imperative in initial discussions. This becomes the&nbsp;initial imperative that is used
        during interviews and analysis. Although the imperative may stand up to further analysis, it needs to be tested
        with the other questions above. In some cases it may need revision (with the client’s agreement) if, for example,
        it is too general (not actionable) as discovered when developing a solution strategy.<br />
        &nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        The <strong>“implied”</strong> imperative: The client sponsor may express only issues and problems where the
        implied imperative is simply “fix this”. Although this information is a helpful starting point, it will be
        necessary to infer the imperative from the results of interviews, analysis and potential solution strategies.<br />
        &nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        The <strong>“too narrow”</strong> imperative: If the imperative is expressed by the client initially, it may be
        very specific, narrow or low level. Accepting this definition may unduly constrain the proposed solution strategy
        and omit other desirable elements of the strategy. This type of imperative may be improved by asking questions that
        lead to a more general definition of the imperative, which addresses not only the original imperative, but other
        vital issues that should have been included.<br />
        &nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        The <strong>“too broad”</strong> imperative: Some imperatives that relate to general business transformation may be
        too broad or abstract to be actionable. In such a case, it may be helpful to decompose the imperative into several
        more specific, actionable imperatives that are supported by analysis of user statements and together satisfy the
        intent of the original imperative. The solution strategy of a broad, complex imperative is likely to have multiple
        significant aspects (referred to as tactics). These aspects (tactics) may indicate that the imperative could be
        refactored into individual imperatives. Ultimately the granularity of the imperative is an arbitrary choice,
        influenced by the need for clarity and actionable individual imperatives.<br />
