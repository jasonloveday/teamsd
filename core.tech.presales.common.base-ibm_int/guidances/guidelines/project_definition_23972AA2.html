    A Project Definition document is written to communicate the project goals and status to everyone and to ensure that
    everyone connected with the project agrees.&nbsp; Project goals can raise issues of scope, function and so on, which
    are best identified as early as possible.&nbsp; This work product will be useful to communicate the goals, scope and
    status of your project in a peer reviews such as a Solution Optimization Workshop, Solution Assurance Review,&nbsp;
    Technical Delivery Assessment or Integrated Technical Review. This guideline addresses specific approaches that should
    be considered when developing the Project Definition.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Buying Behavior</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Buying Behavior describes what is important to the client for this project/opportunity and guides our actions. Three
    distinctly different buying behaviors can exist for an opportunity/project, each reflecting the different value
    criteria clients use to make buying decisions.&nbsp; Our assessment of which Buying Behavior is applicable might change
    as we learn more about the opportunity.&nbsp; Since Buyer Behavior is identified for each opportunity, it is often
    referred to as Opportunity Behavior.
</p>
<p>
    Possible Buying Behaviors are Value for the Money, Trusted Supplier or Innovation Partner.&nbsp; The following chart
    shows what the client values in each case.&nbsp; See:&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://learning.atlanta.ibm.com/hr/global/quickviews/cviqv.nsf/Content/852573E0:006E5F6E" target="_blank">http://learning.atlanta.ibm.com/hr/global/quickviews/cviqv.nsf/Content/852573E0:006E5F6E</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;for
    further information on Opportunity Behavior.&nbsp;&nbsp;

</p>
<p>
    <strong>Project Background</strong>
</p>
<p>
    In many cases, the project may be part of a much larger initiative or set of initiatives within the client, all of
    which, or collectively, are transformational in nature.&nbsp; The relationships between the project and these other
    initiatives should be documented such that the interdependencies can be understood and managed.&nbsp; As these
    relationships become more complicated, the use of the Transformational Roadmap will enhance this understanding.&nbsp;
    One should consider using, and referencing, this artifact when developing the business needs and environment portion of
    the Project Definition.
</p>
<p>
    <br />
    Similarly, as the complexity of a project grows, the number of key requirements may quickly outgrow a simple table
    within the project background portion of the Project Definition.&nbsp; These larger sets of requirements should be
    managed using a more robust work product or tool.&nbsp; Please see Tailoring Team Solution Design for Large, Complex
    Engagements for guidance on which work products to use.&nbsp; The project background portion of the Project Definition
    should reference the appropriate requirements artifact once it is developed.<br />
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Target Solution and Overall Approach</strong>
</p>
<p>
    For larger or more complex engagements, the high level Product Breakdown Structure (PBS) should be used as the basis
    for the development of the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS).&nbsp; Further, this WBS structure should also reflect the
    methods to be employed during delivery (e.g., Custom Application Development or Rapid SAP) so that the schedule and
    costs can be more accurately estimated. The WBS (ENG 362) should be referenced by the Project Definition when and if
    they it is developed.&nbsp; More information can be found in the technique paper “Architectural Methods of System
    Partitioning & Aggregation Including Implications for Project Management” ” located here: <a href="https://w3-connections.ibm.com/wikis/home?lang=en#!/wiki/We1b82e36a0db_41be_9dfd_a2bd4b4619b3/page/System Partitioning" target="_blank">https://w3-connections.ibm.com/wikis/home?lang=en#!/wiki/We1b82e36a0db_41be_9dfd_a2bd4b4619b3/page/System%20Partitioning</a>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Project Scope</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Critical to project success is an agreed-to scope of the project. There are several ways of limiting scope including
    chunking and time-boxing.
</p>
<p>
    Solution increment "chunking" is a way of breaking a large application into smaller "bite sized" pieces which can be
    developed and delivered in a shorter period of time than the total application.&nbsp; These "chunks" may provide
    sufficient functionality so that they may be rolled into production before the complete application is available.&nbsp;
    So, the priority here is the level of function to be delivered. More information can be found in the technique paper
    “Architectural Methods of System Partitioning & Aggregation Including Implications for Project Management” located
    here:&nbsp; <a href="http://w3.tap.ibm.com/w3ki06/display/GBSCSI/System Partitioning" target="_blank">http://w3.tap.ibm.com/w3ki06/display/GBSCSI/System+Partitioning</a>
</p>
<p>
    Time-boxing, as it applies to IT projects like application development or package integration, is a technique for
    iterative development and refinement of an application within a specified timeframe (e.g., 60 days or by a specific
    date).&nbsp; Perhaps some other event is driving this timeframe.&nbsp; All other priorities, including greater function
    or further integration, have to be sacrificed. The project's ultimate goal is to meet the time deadline; whatever else
    happens, the project must not fail to meet this deadline.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    Both of these scope limiting techniques have the following criteria:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Specific project time-frame of deliverable
    </li>
    <li>
        High developer and end-user interaction
    </li>
    <li>
        Specific individual roles and responsibilities<br />
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    When listing the major deliverables for the project, also identify those documents that will comprise the technical
    baseline for the project.&nbsp; These documents, and their revision number, are the basis for the cost and schedule
    committed to the client in the proposal.&nbsp; Any subsequent changes to the assumptions, dependencies, requirements,
    or other content of these documents, after contract signing, may result in the need for a project change request.&nbsp;
    It is this subset of documents that form the baseline for future project change control.
</p>
<p>
    <br />
    In the Customer Satisfaction subsection of Project Scope, the completion criteria for IBM’s work should be documented
    in addition to the client success criteria.&nbsp; It is essential to separate what IBM must accomplish from a
    potentially much larger vision necessary to satisfy the client, especially in those transformational initiatives where
    IBM has a small role to play in a much larger picture,&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Organization</strong>
</p>
<p>
    For TeamSD users, this section contains tables used for defining the project management organization, the sponsor
    organization, delivery organization, and performing organizations.&nbsp; The use of a “RACI” information within such a
    table helps to define the role of each client and IBMer involved in a project and can be critical for success.&nbsp;
    RACI is an acronym for Responsible Accountable, Consulted, or Informed, each of which is defined in the following
    table.&nbsp;
