    Development of architecture begins at the&nbsp;logical level and progresses to the physical level. The following points
    provide additional information on this progression:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The Operational model can be developed at different levels. It begins at a&nbsp;application logical&nbsp;level with
        modest levels of detail. At this level, the primary focus is on the application and data components with less
        concern for technology choices. Progressing to the&nbsp;logical level, the model includes technology
        considerations. Finally, at the physical level, the model will include detailed specifications for actual
        technology and products. For more complex designs, the model will iterate through each of these stages. For simpler
        designs, the model may progress from&nbsp;logical to&nbsp;physical within a very short time. Progression toward the
        physical&nbsp;level will be accelerated by physical constraints placed on the design by the client.
    </li>
    <li>
        At any given time, it is normal to have various aspects of the operational model at different levels ranging from
        logical to physical. The reason is that various aspects of the design progress at different rates. For example,
        during discussion, the client may say that a certain component is constrained by standard to a specific product.
        While the overall model may be at the logical stage, the nodes where that product&nbsp;is likely to be installed
        have moved at least in part to the physical level. The point is to gather information where and when it is
        available and reflect that in the model.
    </li>
    <li>
        In a typical pre-sale context, the IT architect will likely be working at the logical level with some elements at
        the physical&nbsp;level. In general, complete elaboration at the&nbsp;physical level is normally associated with an
        actual implementation phase of the project. During implementation, the pre-sale IT architect is more likely to be
        advising or assisting customer or IBM IT architects who are performing the implementation.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The following illustrates the approach for developing a high level operational model in a pre-sale context.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Create the Logical Operational View (more complex situations may also require a Physical Operational
        View)</strong><br />
        This view consists primarily of nodes, associated deployment units,&nbsp;connections and locations. The level of
        detail in this view will increase as the model progresses from logical to physical. The&nbsp;view may be drawn
        using descriptive symbols for nodes (such as contained in Visio) or simply using rectangles. For more complex
        situations, a tool such as the SA4TeamSD configuration of IBM's Rational System Architect may also be used. For
        relatively simple cases. the detail of the view&nbsp;may vary, including both logical and physical aspects. For
        more complex situations one would normally construct separate logical and physical views. Formal tooling such as
        System Architect would typically require separate views. For such complex situations, consult detailed guidance
        associated with the Operational Model artifact. &nbsp;
    </li>
    <li style="LIST-STYLE-TYPE: none">
        <ul>
            <li>
                Identify the layers and/or locations of the system. A location is a geographic location (such as branch or
                sales office) at which one or more nodes will be located.
            </li>
            <li>
                Identify candidate nodes of the system. A node is an abstraction&nbsp;that&nbsp;contains a collection of
                functional components. Initially, these nodes will be independent of any particular technology unless
                constrained by the client's requirements.
            </li>
            <li>
                Assign nodes to layers or locations as appropriate. A particular type of node may be assigned to multiple
                locations.
            </li>
            <li>
                Identify functional components and determine how they will be mapped to nodes. Initially these are normally
                application components. For some pre-sale engagements, the focus may be on technical components necessary
                for infrastructure. For more complex situations, various aspects of these components may be grouped
                together in Deployment Units (DUs), which are in turn mapped to the nodes. DUs&nbsp;are characterized by
                the operational facets of a component that they contain, such as Presentation, Execution, Data or
                Installation. Every component will have an execution facet and may have other facets such as data as well.
                Components are grouped together in the same DU because they share similar requirements. Initially, the
                actual components represented in these DUs may not be resolved to specific programs or products. It is also
                helpful to assign non functional requirements to DUs. For a complete discussion on DUs, see the appropriate
                UMF artifacts (Deployment Unit Model and Deployment Unit Specification).
            </li>
            <li>
                Identify&nbsp;required inter-node&nbsp;connections of the system. A connection allows communication between
                two nodes based on the needs of the components contained in the nodes.&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
                Identify nonfunctional requirements for each node.&nbsp;A nonfunctional requirement example is: "The
                customer search function must be available 24x7". A nonfunctional requirement may also constrain some
                interface, component, connection or node to a specific standard or product. If Deployment Units are used,
                these node requirements can be derived from the DU's that have been assigned to the node.
            </li>
            <li>
                If it is necessary to&nbsp;advance some aspect of the design to the physical level, determine node and DU
                characteristics and specify appropriate hardware platforms and specification of software components. Also,
                Identify functional components required for technical infrastructure and middleware and specify appropriate
                software products.<br />
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Create the Node Description<br />
        </strong>The node description may be text or a table which contains information such as the following:<br />
        <table cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2" width="100%" border="1">

                    <td>
                        Assign aspects of previously determined nonfunctional requirements to this node as appropriate.
                        This could include such items as performance, capacity, availability etc.
                    </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>
                        <strong>Node Connections</strong>

                    <td>
                        Identify connections from this node to other nodes. For each connection, identify the distant node,
                        protocol, communication style, data characteristics, security requirement etc. This may be arranged
                        as a table relating each node to every other node with connection details at relevant intersections
                        in the table.
                    </td>
                </tr>

                        middleware, hardware features, operating system, connection, system management, security etc.

        layered function.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Create Node-Deployment Unit mapping</strong><br />
        For complex systems where Deployment Units are used, create a table which cross references nodes and deployment
        units.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Create Walkthrough description<br />
        </strong>Walkthroughs may be developed which illustrate step by step events within the system after it responds to
