    This guideline addresses the use of a use case model artifact in a pre-sale context.&nbsp;In general, the level of
    detail in a pre-sale environment will be considerably less than needed during implementation. The primary objectives of
    use case modeling in a pre-sale context are:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Provide a basis for identifying functional and non-functional requirements.
    </li>
    <li>
        Use as a tool to achieve understanding with the client how the proposed solution will work using walk throughs or
        similar approaches
    </li>
    <li>
        Provide&nbsp;a basis for developing demonstrations or proofs of concept.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    In general, the pre-sale context will be limited to a few of the most important use cases and will typically focus on
    the primary scenarios as opposed to error or unusual scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Identify actors:</strong> Actors represent roles performed by users&nbsp;in a business scenario. In the
        pre-sale context, there might be only 1 or 2 actors. These are typically human actors, but could also represent IT
        systems (external to the target system). Primary candidates are the roles performed by the proposed system's key
        users. These might include agents, tellers, supervisors etc. Include actor name and a brief description of the
        actor's role. Role names separate the job description of the user from the way they are using the system.&nbsp; It
        allows the roles to be attached to more than one group of users. Actors can be defined in tables as illustrated
        here:
    </li>
</ul>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
    <p>
        Provide information as indicated in table 1. Note that a full use case model will require additional fields in this
        table. For a complete description, refer to the full guidance associated with this artifact.<br />

</ul>
<p>
    <strong>Note:</strong> In the pre-sale environment, it may be sufficient to document only primary scenarios. A primary
    scenario depicts a scenario in which everything works. As detail is added, the use case may need to accommodate
    variations that could occur in the flow of events that comprise the user / system interaction. For minor variations,
    the description may be augmented with basic pseudo logic (If/Then etc.). For more complex variations, each variation
    could be documented in a separate alternate scenario. Typical prototypes will involve only primary scenarios or very
    limited&nbsp;alternate scenarios. For additional detail, refer to the complete guidance associated with this work
    product.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Create any additional information</strong> required for the Use Case Model. The following information
        describes two of several optional parts of the Use Case Model. If any of these are required, refer to the complete
        guidance associated with this work product.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>Problem Domain Concepts Catalog<br />
    </strong>A concept catalog consists of a list of terms and concepts that provide a concise, common vocabulary and
    consensus definition of domain terminology. The Use Case Model must make comprehensive use of either an internal
    problem domain concepts catalog or other external work product. Examples of external work products that may be used for
    this purpose include classified business terms, object type descriptions and business object model. The catalog is used
    for maintaining consistency across concepts and use cases, including details of naming and semantics.<br />
    <br />
    <strong>System Sequence Diagram<br />
    </strong>The system sequence diagram is a type of interaction diagram that graphically describes the step-by-step
    actor-system interactions for all termination outcomes. Like the flow of events, the system sequence diagram also can
    include conditionals and looping constructs.
