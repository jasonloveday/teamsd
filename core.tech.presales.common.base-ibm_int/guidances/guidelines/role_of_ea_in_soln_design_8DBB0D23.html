    <strong><font size="4">Introduction<br />
    </font></strong>There are numerous definitions of enterprise architecture and its practice and certainly little need to
    create yet another. The following definition of the EA discipline was created by experts in the IBM EA community.
</p>
<blockquote style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px" dir="ltr">
    <p style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px" dir="ltr">
        <em>“The EA discipline defines and maintains the architecture models, governance and transition initiatives needed
        to effectively co-ordinate semi-autonomous groups towards common business and/or IT goals.”</em>
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px" dir="ltr">
    This definition is useful in the sense that this&nbsp;guideline focuses on what is created in the practice of
    enterprise architecture and how it should influence solution design. The following quote from IBM’s EA educational
    material captures this idea succinctly.
</p>
<blockquote style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px" dir="ltr">
    <p style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px" dir="ltr">
        <em>“Enterprise Architecture constrains the individual project, for the benefit of the Enterprise”</em>
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px" dir="ltr">
    Although not a perfect analogy, enterprise architecture is often compared to the concepts embodied in city planning. A
    city plan identifies the common infrastructure needed (streets, utilities, sports and cultural facilities, playgrounds,
    shops, banks, municipal services, etc.) and ensures they are made available. City planning also typically involves
    zoning restrictions that ensure that individual homes can be built in a compatible environment and have convenient
    access to streets and utilities. Some communities have protective covenants that go even further by constraining
    choices in size, building materials and even color. The quote above says it well. With Enterprise architecture, as with
    city planning, the enterprise does benefit, but while the individual project or solution design may be constrained, it
    also benefits by having access to the “utility aspects” and common infrastructure of the enterprise architecture that
    simplify development and integration of a new solution.<br />
</p>
<p style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px" dir="ltr">
    Although enterprise architecture should normally play a role in solution design, the following two cases depict
    examples (hopefully rare) of a plausible reason not to focus on existing enterprise architecture in solution design.
</p>
<ul dir="ltr">
    <li>
        <div style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
            In the first example, the client has explicitly established that the solution will be a completely greenfield
            effort. This means that for some business or technical reasons, the client believes there is value in creating
            a solution that has no dependencies on any existing enterprise architecture. Potential reasons may include the
            need for extremely fast development or an interest in using best of breed technology and design, not previously
            used within the current enterprise architecture.<br />
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
            In the second example, client requirements and specifications are very complete and explicit and constrain the
            solution design in most important aspects. Although not necessarily true, this situation suggests that in
            effect the requirements and specifications reflect the existing enterprise architecture. In essence, key
            architectural decisions have been already made by the client and there is no need to consult their existing
            enterprise architecture.
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>
<p style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px" dir="ltr">
    In most other cases, enterprise architecture should ideally have a prominent role in solution design. This ensures that
    both the enterprise and the solution share in benefits such as common infrastructure and that the individual solution
    fits into the broader strategy in order to achieve common goals.<br />

<p style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px" dir="ltr">
    The remainder of this&nbsp;guideline focuses on how to take advantage of enterprise architecture in solution design.
    The following illustration depicts the relationship between enterprise architecture and solution design.

<p style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px" dir="ltr">
    The ability to take advantage of enterprise architecture in solution design will vary according to the circumstances at
    the client. The following are examples of what one might encounter.
</p>
<ul dir="ltr">
    <li>
        <div style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
            <strong>The client has in place a well documented enterprise architecture,</strong> complete with active
            governance. This may be a rare occurrence, but In this case, the solution design process can derive full
            benefit from being informed by existing EA work products. This is the ideal case. in which one can use examples
            from the following section to identify the appropriate EA work product for guidance in solution design.<br />
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
            <strong>The client has some level of enterprise architecture, but it is not complete or well
            documented.</strong> In this case, there are no documented EA work products to refer to, but it is still
            important to understand whether there are deliberate aspects of an enterprise architecture that may exist.
            There is always an enterprise architecture. Whether it is deliberate, elegant or effective is another matter.
            The suggested approach in this case is to investigate what enterprise architecture may exist by using the
            appropriate EA artifact to guide your research with the client. It may also be helpful in such cases to record
            what exists, even though it may be a partial result. This documentation may be helpful in follow-on projects
            and may even influence the client to more formally document their enterprise architecture.
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The following table illustrates how EA work products influence activities within TeamSD. The relationship to an
    activity is indicated only for the activity where the influenced work product is first created. When an indication of
    influence is indicated for more than one activity (ex: Business Drivers (BUS 314)), it is because the influence relates
    to more than one TeamSD work product.
